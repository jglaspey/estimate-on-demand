## EXAMPLES OF SUCCESSFUL EXTRACTION:

Input: "Total Area: 3,633 SF, Squares: 36.33, Pitch: 5/12"
Output: "totalArea": 3633, "squares": 36.33, "pitch": "5/12"

Input: "Hip / Ridge cap - 104.25 LF - Standard profile - composition shingles"
Output: "quantity": 104.25, "unit": "LF", "description": "Standard profile - composition shingles"

Input: "Counterflashing - Apron flashing - 37.00 LF"
Output: "quantity": 37, "unit": "LF", "description": "Counterflashing - Apron flashing"

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Numbers**: Extract exact numbers as they appear (with decimals if shown)
2. **Units**: Always include the unit (LF, SF, etc.)
3. **Descriptions**: Capture the full material description for quality assessment
4. **Missing Data**: If a field is not found, omit it from JSON (don't include null values)
5. **Multiple Mentions**: If a material appears multiple times, use the most detailed entry

Return this EXACT JSON structure (omit fields not found):
