# Task ID: 17
# Title: Debug API "Failed to fetch jobs" Error
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 15, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Investigate and resolve the "Failed to fetch jobs" error preventing the dashboard-real page from loading job data, focusing on database connection issues and API route problems.
# Details:
1. Diagnostic Investigation:
   - Capture and analyze network requests to identify exact failure points
   - Check browser console for detailed error messages and stack traces
   - Review server logs for API route errors and database connection failures
   - Verify API endpoint configuration in frontend code matches backend routes

2. Database Connection Troubleshooting:
   - Validate database connection string and credentials in environment variables
   - Check for database connection pool exhaustion or timeout issues
   - Verify Prisma client initialization and connection handling
   - Test database connectivity directly using Prisma Studio or similar tools
   - Implement connection retry logic with proper error handling

3. API Route Debugging:
   - Review API route implementation for job data retrieval
   - Check request parameter validation and error handling
   - Verify proper error responses are being returned (status codes and messages)
   - Test API endpoints directly using Postman or curl to isolate frontend vs backend issues
   - Implement detailed logging for API route execution path

4. Data Model Verification:
   - Confirm job data schema matches between frontend expectations and database
   - Check for any recent schema changes that might affect job data retrieval
   - Verify data transformation logic between database and API response

5. Fix Implementation:
   - Implement proper error handling in API routes with informative error messages
   - Add retry mechanism for transient database connection issues
   - Update frontend error handling to provide user-friendly messages
   - Implement loading states to improve user experience during data fetching
   - Add comprehensive logging to facilitate future debugging

6. Performance Optimization:
   - Analyze query performance and optimize if necessary
   - Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed job data
   - Review pagination implementation for large job datasets

# Test Strategy:
1. Error Reproduction Testing:
   - Document exact steps to reproduce the "Failed to fetch jobs" error
   - Create a test environment that consistently reproduces the issue
   - Verify the error occurs under the same conditions as reported

2. API Endpoint Testing:
   - Create automated tests for job data API endpoints
   - Test with various query parameters and edge cases
   - Verify correct error handling for invalid requests
   - Confirm appropriate HTTP status codes are returned

3. Database Connection Testing:
   - Test database connection under various load conditions
   - Verify connection pooling works correctly
   - Simulate connection failures to test error handling
   - Validate retry mechanisms function as expected

4. Integration Testing:
   - Test the complete flow from frontend request to database and back
   - Verify correct data is displayed on the dashboard-real page
   - Test with various job data scenarios (empty, few jobs, many jobs)
   - Validate pagination and filtering functionality

5. User Experience Verification:
   - Confirm appropriate loading states are displayed during data fetching
   - Verify user-friendly error messages appear when issues occur
   - Test recovery paths when connection is restored

6. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure fixes don't introduce new issues in related functionality
   - Verify all dashboard components load and function correctly
   - Test on multiple browsers and devices to ensure compatibility
