Tailwind CSS theme configuration completed with insurance-specific design system. Implemented dual color palette with light/dark modes optimized for document analysis workflows. Typography system uses Inter for UI and JetBrains Mono for code/data display with improved readability for insurance terminology. Created semantic color variables (primary, secondary, muted, destructive) with consistent naming conventions across components. All design tokens (spacing, borders, shadows, transitions) follow accessibility guidelines. Sample page created demonstrating all UI elements and theme variations. All tests pass and configuration is ready for component development phase.
