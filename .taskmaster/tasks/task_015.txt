# Task ID: 15
# Title: Frontend Component Migration: Phase 1 Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate production-ready UI components from the front-end-mockup/ directory into the main application, focusing on immediate visual improvements while backend integration continues.
# Details:
1. Copy and integrate shadcn/ui components:
   - Identify all shadcn/ui components used in the mockup
   - Create or update the /components/ui directory in the main application
   - Copy each component while maintaining folder structure and dependencies
   - Ensure all component props and interfaces are properly typed
   - Verify component styling and functionality matches the mockup

2. Integrate OverviewPage.tsx as the new job analysis dashboard:
   - Copy OverviewPage.tsx to the appropriate route in the main application
   - Update imports to match the new project structure
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly resolved
   - Temporarily connect to mockData for initial rendering
   - Implement responsive behavior according to design specifications

3. Copy business rule components:
   - Migrate HipRidgeCapCard, StarterStripCard, and other business rule components
   - Maintain component hierarchy and internal structure
   - Ensure all props and interfaces are properly typed
   - Preserve interactive functionality (expand/collapse, tooltips, etc.)
   - Verify visual styling matches the mockup

4. Update Tailwind CSS configuration:
   - Compare Tailwind configurations between mockup and main application
   - Merge custom colors, spacing, and other theme extensions
   - Resolve any version compatibility issues
   - Update plugin configurations as needed
   - Ensure consistent styling across all migrated components

5. Integrate mockData.ts types:
   - Copy type definitions from mockData.ts to appropriate locations
   - Create interfaces for all data structures used by the components
   - Ensure type consistency across the application
   - Document data structure requirements for future backend integration
   - Implement type guards where necessary for runtime type safety

6. Test component rendering and functionality:
   - Verify all components render correctly in the main application
   - Test interactive elements (buttons, dropdowns, etc.)
   - Ensure responsive behavior works across breakpoints
   - Validate accessibility features are preserved
   - Document any issues or inconsistencies for future resolution

7. Create placeholder API handlers:
   - Implement temporary API handlers that return mock data
   - Ensure data structure matches the expected backend response
   - Add appropriate loading states and error handling
   - Document API requirements for future backend integration

# Test Strategy:
1. Component Migration Verification:
   - Create a comprehensive inventory of all migrated components
   - Compare each component visually with the original mockup
   - Verify all props and interfaces are correctly implemented
   - Check for any console errors or warnings
   - Validate component nesting and hierarchy matches the mockup

2. UI Rendering Tests:
   - Test each migrated component in isolation using Storybook or similar tool
   - Verify all visual states (default, hover, active, disabled, etc.)
   - Test with various prop combinations to ensure flexibility
   - Validate responsive behavior at all breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Verify animations and transitions work as expected

3. Integration Testing:
   - Test the OverviewPage with mock data
   - Verify all business rule cards render correctly
   - Test interactive elements (expand/collapse, tooltips, etc.)
   - Ensure navigation between components works as expected
   - Validate data flow between components

4. Accessibility Testing:
   - Run automated accessibility tests (axe, lighthouse)
   - Test keyboard navigation throughout the interface
   - Verify screen reader compatibility
   - Check color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards
   - Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate ARIA attributes

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure initial load time of migrated components
   - Test rendering performance with large datasets
   - Verify bundle size impact of new components
   - Check for any unnecessary re-renders
   - Identify optimization opportunities

6. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Verify consistent rendering across browsers
   - Test on both desktop and mobile devices
   - Document any browser-specific issues
