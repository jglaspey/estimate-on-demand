# Task ID: 11
# Title: UI/UX Wireframes and Interactive Prototypes Design
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design comprehensive UI/UX wireframes and interactive prototypes for all user workflows including Document Upload, Data Extraction, Business Rule Analysis, and Report Generation phases with component specifications and visual design system.
# Details:
1. Create user flow diagrams for all major workflows:
   - Document Upload process with validation states
   - Data Extraction with real-time feedback
   - Business Rule Analysis with decision points
   - Report Generation with export options

2. Design wireframes for all key screens:
   - Upload interface with drag-and-drop area and file previews
   - Job Dashboard with extraction progress indicators
   - Business Rule cards with expandable evidence panels
   - Decision interface with accept/reject controls
   - Report summary with visualization options

3. Develop interactive prototypes using Figma or Adobe XD:
   - Include all state transitions and animations
   - Create clickable navigation between screens
   - Simulate loading states and progress indicators
   - Demonstrate error handling and validation feedback

4. Define component specifications:
   - Document component hierarchy and nesting
   - Specify props/inputs for each component
   - Define state management requirements
   - Document event handlers and callbacks

5. Create visual design system:
   - Color palette with primary, secondary, and accent colors
   - Typography scale with heading and body text styles
   - Form element styles (inputs, buttons, dropdowns)
   - Data visualization components (charts, graphs)
   - Status indicators and badges

6. Design responsive layouts:
   - Desktop-first approach with breakpoints for smaller screens
   - Define grid system and spacing guidelines
   - Ensure critical workflows function on tablet devices

7. Document interaction patterns:
   - Define hover, active, and focus states
   - Document transitions and animations
   - Specify loading indicators and progress feedback
   - Define error and success state visuals

8. Create accessibility guidelines:
   - Color contrast requirements
   - Keyboard navigation patterns
   - Screen reader considerations
   - Focus management guidelines

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct internal design reviews:
   - Review wireframes against user stories and requirements
   - Verify all required screens and states are represented
   - Ensure design system consistency across all screens
   - Check component specifications for completeness

2. Perform usability testing with prototype:
   - Create test scenarios covering all major workflows
   - Recruit 5-7 testers representing target users
   - Record sessions and collect qualitative feedback
   - Measure task completion rates and time-on-task

3. Validate accessibility compliance:
   - Test color contrast with accessibility tools
   - Verify keyboard navigation works for all interactions
   - Review screen reader compatibility
   - Check focus management across interactive elements

4. Technical feasibility review:
   - Review with development team for implementation concerns
   - Identify any technically challenging interactions
   - Validate state management approach with developers
   - Ensure responsive layouts are practical to implement

5. Stakeholder presentation and feedback:
   - Present prototypes to project stakeholders
   - Collect feedback on visual design and interactions
   - Document requested changes and prioritize revisions
   - Obtain final approval before development begins
