This is the same critical field that made Haiku superior in previous testing - but here Mistral wins.\n\n## Mistral Capabilities Analysis:\n- **Does NOT support direct PDF processing** - API requires image_url format only\n- **Excellent at text analysis** - Better field detection than expected\n- **Cost-effective for text-only**: ~/bin/zsh.001 vs Haiku's /bin/zsh.0112 for this test\n- **Faster processing**: 3163ms vs Haiku's 4574ms\n- **Perfect JSON compliance** - Clean structured output\n\n## Strategic Implications:\n\n1. **Hybrid Extraction Strategy**: Text extraction + Mistral analysis could be highly effective fallback\n2. **Cost Optimization**: Mistral text analysis is 10x cheaper than Haiku direct PDF for some cases\n3. **Accuracy Potential**: Mistral may find fields that Haiku misses in certain document types\n4. **Processing Pipeline**: pdf-parse → text cleaning → Mistral analysis = viable alternative path\n\nThis challenges our assumption that direct PDF is always superior. Text extraction may actually yield better field detection for certain document formats.\n</info added on 2025-08-13T06:51:02.020Z>",
