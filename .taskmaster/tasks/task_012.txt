# Task ID: 12
# Title: Hip/Ridge Business Rule Deep Dive Analysis
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Analyze prototype learnings, design data extraction patterns, processing workflows, and database optimization strategy specifically for the Hip/Ridge cap business rule implementation.
# Details:
1. Review prototype implementation data and user feedback:
   - Analyze user interaction patterns with the Hip/Ridge rule
   - Document pain points and improvement opportunities
   - Identify edge cases not handled by current implementation

2. Design optimized data extraction patterns:
   - Create specialized extraction algorithms for Hip/Ridge measurements from roof diagrams
   - Define pattern recognition techniques for identifying Hip/Ridge features in documents
   - Establish confidence scoring methodology for extracted Hip/Ridge data
   - Document required input fields and optional enhancements

3. Design processing workflows:
   - Map complete Hip/Ridge rule processing flow from document upload to decision
   - Identify optimization opportunities in the analysis pipeline
   - Create decision tree for Hip/Ridge rule validation logic
   - Define error handling and fallback procedures for incomplete data
   - Document integration points with other business rules

4. Database optimization strategy:
   - Design efficient schema for storing Hip/Ridge specific measurements and calculations
   - Create indexing strategy for Hip/Ridge rule queries
   - Define caching approach for frequently accessed Hip/Ridge data
   - Document data retention and archiving policies

5. Create comprehensive documentation:
   - Develop technical specification for Hip/Ridge rule implementation
   - Create developer guide with code examples and implementation patterns
   - Document all business logic and calculation formulas
   - Prepare knowledge transfer materials for future rule implementations

6. Establish metrics and monitoring:
   - Define KPIs for Hip/Ridge rule performance and accuracy
   - Create monitoring dashboard for Hip/Ridge rule processing
   - Establish baseline performance metrics for future comparison

7. Rule 1 (Hip/Ridge) extraction inputs and mapping:
   - Define required extraction inputs:
     * roofMeasurements: {ridgeLength, hipLength, eaveLength, rakeLength, squares, slope}
     * estimate line item: {code, description, quantity (LF), unitPrice, totalPrice}
   - Map source document pages to each extracted value for evidence traceability
   - Design extraction output schema as structured JSON format
   - Ensure extraction output is fully compatible with `mapDatabaseToRidgeCapData` function
   - Establish strict separation between Extraction and Analysis components
   - Document data transformation patterns between extraction output and RuleAnalysisResult
   - Define validation requirements for extracted data before analysis processing

# Test Strategy:
1. Prototype analysis validation:
   - Review findings with stakeholders to confirm accuracy
   - Validate that all user feedback has been properly categorized
   - Verify edge cases are comprehensive and well-documented

2. Data extraction pattern testing:
   - Test extraction algorithms against sample documents with known Hip/Ridge features
   - Validate confidence scoring against human-verified data
   - Measure extraction accuracy across different document types and formats
   - Verify performance meets requirements for production use

3. Processing workflow validation:
   - Conduct walkthrough of complete workflow with development team
   - Verify all decision paths in the Hip/Ridge rule logic
   - Test error handling with deliberately malformed inputs
   - Validate integration points with mock implementations of dependent systems

4. Database optimization verification:
   - Benchmark query performance with proposed schema and indexing
   - Load test with production-scale data volumes
   - Verify caching strategy improves performance as expected
   - Validate data integrity through various update scenarios

5. Documentation review:
   - Conduct peer review of all technical documentation
   - Verify completeness of business logic documentation
   - Test implementation of sample code in documentation
   - Have a developer unfamiliar with the system attempt to implement features using only the documentation

6. Metrics baseline establishment:
   - Verify all KPIs can be accurately measured
   - Establish performance benchmarks for future comparison
   - Validate monitoring dashboard provides actionable insights
