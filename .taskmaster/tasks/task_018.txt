# Task ID: 18
# Title: WebSocket Implementation for Real-Time Job Progress Tracking
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 16, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement WebSocket functionality to provide real-time updates on document processing jobs, including server setup, client connection management, progress event broadcasting, and UI integration.
# Details:
1. WebSocket Server Implementation:
   - Set up a WebSocket server using Socket.IO or native WebSockets
   - Configure the server to run alongside the existing API routes
   - Implement authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections
   - Create namespaces for different types of events (job progress, notifications)
   - Set up error handling and connection recovery mechanisms

2. Client Connection Management:
   - Implement connection pooling to handle multiple concurrent clients
   - Create a connection registry to track active clients and their subscriptions
   - Implement heartbeat mechanism to detect disconnected clients
   - Add reconnection logic with exponential backoff
   - Create middleware for validating client connections

3. Job Progress Event System:
   - Modify the document processing queue to emit progress events
   - Create standardized event payloads with job ID, status, progress percentage
   - Implement event throttling to prevent overwhelming clients
   - Add detailed status messages for each processing stage
   - Create event hooks at key points in the processing pipeline

4. Real-Time UI Updates:
   - Implement a WebSocket client in the frontend
   - Create a ProgressTracker component with visual indicators
   - Add animated progress bars for active jobs
   - Implement toast notifications for job status changes
   - Create a central WebSocket context provider for app-wide access
   - Add error handling and offline mode for WebSocket disconnections

5. Testing and Monitoring:
   - Implement WebSocket connection logging
   - Create monitoring endpoints for WebSocket server health
   - Add performance metrics collection for connection counts and message throughput
   - Implement load testing for concurrent connections

# Test Strategy:
1. WebSocket Server Testing:
   - Verify server can handle multiple concurrent connections
   - Test authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Validate server performance under load with simulated clients
   - Test server recovery after crashes or restarts
   - Verify proper cleanup of disconnected clients

2. Client Connection Testing:
   - Test client reconnection logic with forced disconnections
   - Verify heartbeat mechanism correctly identifies dead connections
   - Test connection registry accuracy with multiple clients
   - Validate connection pooling under high load
   - Test authentication token expiration and renewal

3. Progress Event Testing:
   - Verify events are emitted at all key processing stages
   - Test event payload structure and completeness
   - Validate event delivery to subscribed clients only
   - Test throttling mechanism under high event frequency
   - Verify events are received in correct order

4. UI Integration Testing:
   - Test progress bar updates with simulated job progress events
   - Verify toast notifications appear for status changes
   - Test UI behavior during WebSocket disconnections
   - Validate progress tracking across multiple simultaneous jobs
   - Test UI responsiveness during high-frequency updates

5. End-to-End Testing:
   - Create automated tests that upload documents and verify progress tracking
   - Test with various document sizes and processing times
   - Verify final job completion events trigger appropriate UI updates
   - Test system behavior with network interruptions
   - Validate performance with multiple users tracking multiple jobs

6. Add middleware to validate client permissions for specific job subscriptions
7. Implement clean disconnection handling to remove clients from registry
8. Create methods to broadcast messages to specific clients or groups

## 3. Develop job progress event system [done]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Modify the document processing queue to emit progress events at key stages and create a standardized event payload structure.
### Details:
1. Identify key progress points in the document processing pipeline
2. Add event emitters at each stage (upload, extraction, analysis, completion)
3. Create a standardized event payload format with jobId, status, progress percentage, and timestamp
4. Implement event throttling to limit updates to max 1 per second per job
5. Add detailed status messages for each processing stage
6. Create a central EventEmitter that connects to the WebSocket server
7. Modify the job queue processor to emit events when status changes
