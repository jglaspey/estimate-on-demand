Successfully implemented CreateNewJob page with all requested features:

- Complete page layout matching job detail design
- Skeleton loading states with pulsing animation for all UI elements
- Large central drop zone with exact requested text
- Drag-and-drop functionality with visual feedback
- File validation (PDF only, 10MB limit)
- Upload progress tracking with spinner and progress bar
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- API integration ready for /api/upload endpoint
- Automatic redirect to analysis page after upload

The page serves as the "before" state that transforms into real-time progress tracking. All skeleton elements will populate with actual data as OCR and business rule analysis complete, providing users with a transparent workflow experience.

## Phase 1 vs Phase 2 Separation and PDF Submission Options

- Phase 1 (Priority Fields, 30–60s): Call Claude Haiku messages API with PDF as base64 for small files; for larger files use Claude Files API (upload once, reference file_id). No analysis beyond field parsing. Update Job immediately; emit WS 45%.

- Phase 2 (Background Full Extraction): Use Mistral OCR /v1/ocr. Prefer data: URL (base64) for small files; for large PDFs use hosted URL or Mistral Files+signed URL. Save page text to DocumentPage. Keep extraction and analysis strictly separate.

- Add optional Mistral pages parameter for quick partial runs (e.g., [1,2]) before full doc.

   - 2b Measurement Normalizer (roof report): parse {ridgeLength, hipLength, eaveLength, rakeLength, valleyLength, squares, slope, stories, sourcePages}.
   - Merge into latest MistralExtraction.extractedData. No compliance decisions here.
