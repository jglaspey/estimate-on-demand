# Task ID: 16
# Title: Debug and Fix Document Extraction Pipeline Failures
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Investigate and resolve critical errors in the document extraction pipeline, including Mistral API "Unexpected token 'S'" errors and "Invalid 'prisma.document.create'" database issues to ensure reliable document processing.
# Details:
1. Diagnose Mistral API "Unexpected token 'S'" errors:
   - Review API call implementation and response handling
   - Capture and analyze raw API responses to identify malformed JSON
   - Check for potential encoding issues or unexpected response formats
   - Implement proper response validation before JSON parsing

2. Fix JSON parsing issues:
   - Add robust error handling around JSON.parse() operations
   - Implement try/catch blocks with detailed error logging
   - Create sanitization functions to handle unexpected characters in responses
   - Add response validation to ensure proper structure before processing

3. Debug Prisma database errors:
   - Review "Invalid 'prisma.document.create'" error traces
   - Validate schema compliance of document objects before database insertion
   - Check for missing required fields or invalid data types
   - Ensure proper error handling for database operations

4. Enhance error logging and monitoring:
   - Implement structured logging for extraction pipeline failures
   - Add context-rich error messages with document IDs and processing stage
   - Create error categorization system to group similar failures
   - Set up alerting for critical extraction failures

5. Implement fallback mechanisms:
   - Create retry logic with exponential backoff for API failures
   - Implement alternative extraction paths when primary method fails
   - Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
   - Create queue system for failed documents to retry processing later

6. Test extraction pipeline:
   - Create test suite with sample documents representing different formats
   - Implement integration tests for the complete extraction flow
   - Add unit tests for individual components of the pipeline
   - Create stress tests to identify performance bottlenecks

7. Ensure database schema compliance:
   - Validate extraction results against Prisma schema requirements
   - Implement data transformation layer to normalize API responses
   - Add pre-save validation to catch schema violations
   - Create data migration utilities for handling schema changes

# Test Strategy:
1. Error Reproduction Testing:
   - Create a test environment that reproduces both the Mistral API and Prisma database errors
   - Document exact steps and conditions that trigger each error
   - Verify error patterns match those observed in production

2. API Response Validation:
   - Test API response handling with mocked responses containing the problematic "S" token
   - Verify proper handling of malformed JSON responses
   - Test with various error conditions from the Mistral API
   - Validate retry logic works correctly for temporary API failures

3. Database Operation Testing:
   - Create test cases for document creation with valid and invalid data
   - Verify proper validation before database operations
   - Test error handling for database constraint violations
   - Validate transaction rollback works correctly on failure

4. End-to-End Pipeline Testing:
   - Test complete extraction pipeline with sample documents
   - Verify documents flow through all processing stages correctly
   - Validate successful extraction results in proper database entries
   - Test error handling at each stage of the pipeline

5. Logging and Monitoring Validation:
   - Verify all errors are properly logged with sufficient context
   - Test error categorization system with various failure types
   - Validate alerts are triggered for critical failures
   - Ensure logs contain enough information for debugging

6. Performance and Reliability Testing:
   - Test extraction pipeline with high volume of documents
   - Measure success rate and processing time
   - Verify system stability under load
   - Test recovery from various failure scenarios

7. Regression Testing:
   - Verify fixes don't introduce new issues in the extraction pipeline
   - Test with previously successful documents to ensure continued functionality
   - Validate all business rules still work with fixed extraction pipeline
