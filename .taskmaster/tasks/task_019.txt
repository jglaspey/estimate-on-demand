# Task ID: 19
# Title: Job Detail Page with Split-Pane Interface Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 13, 7, 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a job detail page with a split-pane interface that displays business rules analysis on the left and a document viewer on the right, integrating production-ready components from the front-end-mockup directory.
# Details:
1. Component Integration:
   - Import and integrate production-ready components from the front-end-mockup/ directory
   - Ensure components follow the established project structure and coding standards
   - Refactor components as needed to work with the current state management approach

2. Split-Pane Layout Implementation:
   - Create a responsive SplitPaneLayout component with resizable panels
   - Implement drag handle for adjusting panel widths with minimum width constraints
   - Add keyboard accessibility for panel resizing (arrow keys with modifier)
   - Save user's preferred panel configuration to localStorage for persistence

3. JobDetailsCard Implementation:
   - Integrate the JobDetailsCard component for displaying insurance and customer information
   - Connect to the data store to populate fields with real extraction data
   - Implement collapsible sections for better space management
   - Add edit functionality with proper validation for correcting extracted information

4. BusinessRuleCard Components:
   - Integrate all four BusinessRuleCard components (Ridge Cap, Starter Strip, Drip Edge, Ice & Water Barrier)
   - Implement status indicators showing rule analysis progress/results
   - Add interactive elements for user decision tracking
   - Create expandable evidence sections showing supporting documentation

5. ContextualDocumentViewer Integration:
   - Implement PDF viewer with pagination, zoom, and rotation controls
   - Add highlighting functionality to connect extracted data with source locations
   - Create bidirectional navigation between form fields and document locations
   - Implement caching strategy for improved performance with large documents

6. Mistral OCR Data Integration:
   - Create data adapters to transform Mistral OCR extraction data to component-compatible format
   - Implement loading states for asynchronous data fetching
   - Add error handling for missing or malformed extraction data
   - Create fallback UI states for incomplete data scenarios

7. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement virtualization for large document rendering
   - Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive component calculations
   - Optimize re-renders with proper state management
   - Add progressive loading for large documents

8. Accessibility Considerations:
   - Ensure proper keyboard navigation throughout the interface
   - Add ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility
   - Implement focus management for modal dialogs and expandable sections
   - Test with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation

# Test Strategy:
1. Component Integration Testing:
   - Verify all components from front-end-mockup directory are properly integrated
   - Test component styling matches UI mockups across different screen sizes
   - Validate component behavior matches expected functionality
   - Ensure no console errors or warnings are present

2. Split-Pane Layout Testing:
   - Test resizing functionality with mouse drag operations
   - Verify minimum width constraints prevent panels from becoming too small
   - Test keyboard accessibility for panel resizing
   - Confirm panel configuration persists across page refreshes
   - Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes

3. Data Integration Testing:
   - Verify JobDetailsCard correctly displays insurance and customer information
   - Test all four BusinessRuleCard components with various data scenarios
   - Validate ContextualDocumentViewer properly displays PDF documents
   - Test with both complete and partial data sets to verify fallback behaviors

4. Interaction Testing:
   - Verify bidirectional navigation between form fields and document locations
   - Test highlighting functionality in the document viewer
   - Validate user decision tracking in business rule components
   - Test expandable sections and modal dialogs

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and verify initial load time is under 2 seconds for typical documents
   - Test with large documents (50+ pages) to verify performance
   - Validate smooth scrolling and zooming in document viewer
   - Measure memory usage during extended use sessions

6. Cross-Browser Testing:
   - Test functionality in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Verify consistent appearance across browsers
   - Validate PDF rendering works correctly in all supported browsers

7. Accessibility Testing:
   - Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver) to verify proper announcements
   - Verify keyboard navigation works throughout the interface
   - Test focus management in modal dialogs and expandable sections
   - Validate color contrast meets WCAG AA standards

8. Integration Testing:
   - Verify the page integrates correctly with the WebSocket system for real-time updates
   - Test navigation between job dashboard and job detail page
   - Validate proper state management when switching between multiple jobs
