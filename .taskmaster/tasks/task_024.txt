# Task ID: 24
# Title: Security Hardening for File Storage and Database Access
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 21
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive security measures for file storage and database access, including access controls, encryption, API protection, and tenant isolation to safeguard sensitive insurance documents and PII.
# Details:
1. File Storage Security:
   - Implement S3/R2 cloud storage integration to replace local file storage
   - Configure bucket policies with least privilege access controls
   - Set up server-side encryption at rest (AES-256)
   - Implement signed URLs with short expiration for temporary file access
   - Create file access middleware to verify user/organization permissions
   - Integrate virus/malware scanning for all uploaded files using ClamAV or cloud service
   - Implement organized file structure by job/document type (replacing current timestamp naming)
   - Create file metadata tracking system for enhanced security and auditing
   - Implement file retention policies with automated enforcement
   - Add file versioning for complete audit trail
   - Configure Railway volumes as an alternative cloud storage option with appropriate security settings

2. Database Security:
   - Implement Row-Level Security (RLS) policies in PostgreSQL
   - Create organization/tenant isolation through database schemas or tenant_id columns
   - Set up database connection pooling with encrypted connections
   - Implement database query parameterization to prevent SQL injection
   - Create data access layer with permission checks before query execution
   - Configure field-level encryption for PII fields (SSN, DOB, etc.)
   - Configure Railway database security settings including backup policies and access controls

3. API Route Protection:
   - Implement JWT validation middleware for all protected routes
   - Set up role-based access control (RBAC) for API endpoints
   - Create rate limiting using Redis to prevent abuse (max 100 req/min per IP)
   - Configure proper CORS settings to restrict cross-origin requests
   - Implement security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
   - Add request logging and audit trails for sensitive operations
   - Develop secure file retrieval API with authentication and authorization checks

4. Input Validation & Sanitization:
   - Implement server-side validation beyond basic type checking
   - Add content sanitization for all user inputs to prevent XSS
   - Create file type validation with content inspection (not just extension)
   - Implement maximum file size limits and chunked upload for large files
   - Add JSON schema validation for all API request payloads

5. Compliance & Best Practices:
   - Implement audit logging for all security-relevant events
   - Create secure document retention and deletion policies
   - Set up automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
   - Document security controls for compliance with insurance regulations
   - Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
   - Create security incident response procedures
   - Ensure Railway compliance with data protection requirements for insurance documents

6. Integration with Authentication:
   - Design security components to integrate with future auth system
   - Create placeholder hooks for user/role information
   - Implement temporary security measures until auth system is complete
   - Document integration points for future auth system

7. Railway-Specific Security Configuration:
   - Configure Railway environment variables securely with encryption for sensitive values
   - Set up Railway volume security for file storage with proper access controls
   - Implement Railway networking security with private networking where applicable
   - Configure Railway SSL/TLS settings for all services
   - Implement Railway access controls and team permissions with least privilege principle
   - Configure Railway audit logging for security events
   - Set up Railway backup and disaster recovery procedures

# Test Strategy:
1. File Storage Security Testing:

   - Test file access controls with different user permissions
   - Validate encryption at rest is properly configured
   - Verify signed URLs expire correctly and prevent unauthorized access
   - Test virus scanning with EICAR test files
   - Validate file access logs capture all relevant metadata
   - Test organized file structure implementation with various document types
   - Verify file metadata tracking system captures all required information
   - Test file retention policies with time-based scenarios
   - Validate file versioning maintains proper audit trail
   - Test Railway volume security configuration for file storage

2. Database Security Testing:
   - Test RLS policies with different user contexts
   - Verify tenant isolation prevents cross-tenant data access
   - Validate field-level encryption for PII data
   - Test database connection security with network scanning tools
   - Perform SQL injection testing against all database queries
   - Verify query performance with security measures enabled
   - Test Railway database security settings and backup procedures

3. API Security Testing:
   - Test JWT validation with valid, invalid, and expired tokens
   - Verify RBAC correctly limits access based on user roles
   - Test rate limiting by exceeding thresholds
   - Validate CORS configuration blocks unauthorized origins
   - Verify security headers using tools like Mozilla Observatory
   - Test API routes without authentication to confirm proper protection
   - Test secure file retrieval API with various authentication scenarios

4. Penetration Testing:
   - Conduct automated security scanning with OWASP ZAP
   - Perform manual penetration testing of critical endpoints
   - Test file upload security with malicious file types
   - Attempt privilege escalation between different user roles
