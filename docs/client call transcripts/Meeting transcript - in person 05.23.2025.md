# Transcript for Storm

How's it feeling back in the office? Yeah, it feels great to be back in the office. It feels nice. Yeah, I'm sad because, I mean, ultimately, part of the reason we're here is to move out. And like, looking at all this, being like, what the fuck am I going to do with some of this shit? Like, I'm not taking it home, which I'm going to give it away. But that's, like, not even easy. That fridge belongs to the office, right? It does. But, like, I have two fully white tables. Like, I'm not going to take those on a plane. Then, like, and this table. And that. Courtney might buy those tables right here. I mean, so what I'm probably going to do is have like a garage sale. But I'm probably going to be like, if you come and you take it, I won't charge you. Like. I mean, I would definitely have one of those tables trying to figure out. Part of it is just like, I feel like two years ago, I finally said, fuck it, I'm going to buy the things that I want because there are a handful of things that I'd just like to have here. Like, a fucking desk and a monitor and a monitor arm and a thing. And like... I mean, someone buys a desk for me. I'm sure. But it's just like, I finally got it all together. And then I'm like, taking my energy elsewhere. But not that I'll never come back, but like, where do I store this? Do I literally just keep an office? Like, maybe I should. Like, when it all settles, just like keep paying to split an office with someone to store most of the shit in it in case we ever come back. But then it's like, am I going to hate myself because I didn't just pick the scab? You know? I mean, it's going to add up to a lot of money. What's that? It's going to add up to a lot of money. You know, no matter what, if you keep paying for an office. Yeah. You don't want to do that. Yeah, I mean, that's another thing. It's like, yeah, if I pay two years, I pay like $100 a month. Two years from now, it's $24.

Yeah, I could replace all of this. Right, exactly. What's $240? That's the storage, the new storage thing. It's like, do I really need to store it or can I just sell it and buy it again? Yeah. What do you want me to do? Alright, so what I'd like to do is yesterday you were talking about kind of some like, if this, then that flows. Yeah. So I wanted to take your existing mermaid dock and just kind of make sure like, is this still the correct way to be thinking about it? And it's fucking pumped. Yeah, if you want, we can turn the AC on. Just turn the door shut. Mermaid. You know what I just ordered today? What was that? A fucking. Have you ever heard of Sleep 8? Or 8 Sleep? Yeah. I ordered one of those pods today. Oh, really? Yeah. Like $3,500. And they cool your bed, right? Yeah. But it's like dual zone. Yeah. I just figure like it's $3,500, but I spent a third of my life in my bed. Plus, it'll help me save money on my AC. You probably run your AC way less. I mean, I'll start the run. But like, it just won't be struggling. Yeah. To keep the whole room at fucking 70. Yeah. Bam. Well, that's really interesting. When it came, like, I booked, or I kick-started their bed cover. Oh, really? Because it had, it was a bed co-I love, or Holly loves to be warm. And so we had this. I was a kid and I had an electric blanket, and I hated an electric blanket on top of me. Like, it had wires in it. They were old, which I'm sure they're better now, but like, I don't want that on top of me. Yeah, it's not like a green. And I'm like, but underneath me sounds great. And Holly can turn hers on, and it was like.

Like fucking just nine o'clock, her bed started warming up every night. Yeah, it's fucking dope. And so every night she'd be getting in, she'd be like so happy and wait. But there's always like connectivity problems because it was a first-generation product. Yeah. And it was called Luna at the time. And then they had to change to eight because there was a Luna mattress. There's a Luna mattress. Yeah, I have one of those. With two of them. Three of them. I just bought one from Marvel. Oh, nice. Yeah. But so anyway, that I have been aware of that company for a while, and their cooling pods make a ton of sense here. Yeah. A ton of sense here. I mean, we'll see. Mario's going to shoot her pants when she gets her mattress. I'm sure most people in Mexico have not had a mattress like those. New ones are. Because she stays at our house moonly. Oh, right. She sleeps in the guest room. She and her and Edder, her husband, Edder's like, fuck. And so the last time they stayed her up for like three weeks and they take her to the dogs and the editor does like little things around the house and I was like, hey, I always pay them to stay there even though they don't want any money. And I'm like, I'm just going to buy you a mattress. It's like $1,000. They're like, it's too much. I'm like, yeah, but Edder's got back problems and you guys should have a fucking good mattress that'll last you for the rest of your life. We've had them one in our guest burger for a decade. And every day they're going to get up and be like, Love you storm. Yeah. Think about how good your body feels today. Is that the mermaid tracker I made? Yeah. Okay. So click project name, upload insurance, upload roof report, splits into two sides: the estimate path and the roof report path. Yeah. There we go. For now, let's just take a look at the roof report.

Easy, easy, easy, easy. This is actually that's been kind of. I've gotten weird results there, but I think I have a solution. Number of stories? Yeah, it's because different reports put in different spots, I think. Yeah, but and actually, that it's helpful, but it's not something that's super pertinent. It just relates to one single charge. Okay. There's an additional charge for working on a two-short roof because you have to climb higher, so there's like a loss of productivity and additional safety measures. Check for gable cornice strips and returns and kick outs. The gable corner strips ones are going to be really hard. That's what I was finding out. Unless it's on a hover report, because on a hover report, it'll typically show up. Okay. So you can get rid of those. What do I want? I'm going to. I can't believe those guys. They didn't start pouring that fucking thing until like noon. So fucking hot, oh man. They were pissed. Why did they get there so late? The conquered guys are always late. Always. That's Maribelle's brother-in-law or father-in-law. Okay. So, you said the gable cornice returns, I can't see. The gable cornice strips and the gable's cornice returns. You can probably. That could come up and go back to the later. Because it's not gonna, it'll only say it.

In the hover report. But like, you can see it in an EcoView report, for example, or GAF, Quick Measure, or Roofer, but it doesn't explicitly say that it's there. So you have to know what you're looking at, right? So it's hard to. I don't know how to even describe that to an LLM. Okay. And I understand what they are, and that it'd be basically what I've learned is it'd be really hard to see at the fidelity of the photos that were provided. Absolutely. Same thing with a kickoff flashing. You won't say that on any of the roof reports. But it's just like you looking at a roof diagram and tell where it's required. So one of the things I was thinking there is: does it make sense to, like, if there was an, and there's two things happening. Like, one, what is the baseline to get us an MVP that's helping? Yeah. And then in the long term, having a workflow and a like user interface that actually makes the manual steps really easy and fast. So like rather than like you have to check this, it actually says you have to check this and here's the image and here's the PDF and here's what we think it is and you either put yes or no and change. Like that's an ideal workflow. In situations like this, are there things like where we could tee that up to make the double checking or does it really not matter? You just need to be like, does the, or how do you determine right now if those things, if it's not on a hover? I just have to look at the diagram for photos. Okay. And is that something that you think has like if you had a is it worth trying to build a specific function that says like send these pictures to an LLM and have it ask these explicit questions to determine does this meet

Those requirements, or does this not right now? I don't think we should be dealing with like photos. Okay, perfect. So you have to get yeah, I don't think we should have to deal with photos. So you have you're gonna have so many different ways people take photographs or don't take photographs. You know, you have to get people to do photographs the right way. That's really hard. Okay, so for now, we're just gonna be like, this is a manual process that it'll identify. Yeah, okay. Like the heavy lifting is text. Text? I can look at the roof report and I can look at the carrier estimate and I can find 80% of what needs to be added to the estimate without ever letting me input it. Okay. Just because the errors are either in measurements or they just completely missed a lining. Okay. But it's on an app, it's on a shingle proof. So. And is that situation? Like. Because right now. So I haven't seen him. He was here yesterday. Do you water your breath? I think so. I washed this out in there. So. Ah, fucker.

It occurred to me that there's a product that you could build, I think, from what we were talking about yesterday, like pretty quickly that could generate revenue very fast. Keep talking. So remember how I told you that we send these files to this guy in the Philippines to basically like copy from the PDF to the Xactimate file? Uh-huh. So we have him, that's what we're transcribed. So you can teach the LLM to read the PDF and take those PDF, those line items and Xactimate. And if you just gave it the list of the codes that associated. So the way the line item looks on the printout that the customer gets, you know, it'll just say like, tear out asphalt shingles, lambda asphalt shingles. But in Xactimate, that's RFG A R M V N. Okay. So, but you could give it, you could give the LLM a spreadsheet of all the category codes, the selector codes, and the description so it would be able to match those up easily. And if you could teach it how to go on to Xactimate Online, like if you have an Xactimate Online account, and someone could just be like, they could, you'd be like, here's my insurance company that's going to transcribe this into an Xactimate ESX file, generate it, and send it back to me. Let's try to do it right now. Okay. I mean, dude, that would save me fucking $8 on every job I do. Something here? Yeah, why don't you...



So actually, we might not be able to do that right now because I don't have a license for Exactly Online. They don't let you switch in between the two. Well, you can't, but you have to like context sales. But if you want to do that, dude, like, and you seriously think you could do it, it would be so easy. Well, here's what it does. So it basically takes the HTML and it creates like every link has a understands each link. So if it needs to, like, oh, it needs to click there, well, then you click 21, so to speak. And it can just, oh, do this, then here, then here, then here, then here, and it can just. This is terrible sound. Yeah. I think it'd be really, really easy. Well, I will upgrade my account tomorrow. What is that? Online. How much is an online account? Probably like $3,000 a year or something like that. Oh. Yeah, that's fucking expensive. We have a one-month option for $330. Yeah, but I have like for me to upgrade, I actually need to upgrade for work anyway because then I can share my settings with everybody that works for me. Okay. And so we can have the same notes and like the same tools and everything. And I've never done it because of the cost. Now we're getting so fucking busy, like, I should just do it. Jerk chicken, baby. I lack. Very much. Well, then, do you want to do that tonight and then we can try this tomorrow? Yeah, but what else? Yeah, but I mean, like, do you want to?

Or we can try that before you leave. Okay. Like, because I'll get browser use set up so that I'm ready to give it a URL and some commands. I mean, that would save me, that would just save me $1,000 a month. What I pay. When I think of Harold, I mean, fuck Harold. Whatever. He'll be fine. I think of the Asian dude from Gangnam Style, that song, because his profile photo on Gmail looks like that guy, and he's got like a little Pomeranian. You know, I never talked to him. I never spoke with the guy. Ever. Yeah. But he makes more money. He's like in the top 1% of earners in the Philippines. Because I know he works for other clients. I'm not his only one. He's making $1,000 a month off of me. He's probably making like $4,000 or $5,000 a month. He might have several people under him. Yeah, exactly. He's just driving around. I just imagine him driving around a Ferrari. Yeah. Okay, well then. So either tomorrow or Monday, let's try and spend an hour or two and I'll try and have browser use set up. Okay. Yesterday you were talking a little bit about like, you're like, honestly, if it just did, is this in the report, yes or no? And is this in the report, yes. And if this is there, then make sure we set this up. You kind of had like a simplified flow. And I'd like to capture that. So I can give you like one easy example. Okay, so here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to have this is Storm introducing an example of a project. Listen to this, and then we're going to turn this into a flowchart in Mermaid. Okay, so basically, you would want the model to analyze the people.

PDF, determine if the PDF contains a line item for gutter apron. Okay. And if it does, make sure that the linear feet matches the eve measurement from the roof report. If it doesn't, generate text that says gutter apron is not present in this report, but there should be X amount of feet, which is the same as the Eve measurement from the roof report of gutter apron in this report. Okay. That's it. Easy. Yeah. And it also needs to extract address, the total roof area, total roof facets. Of course. All that stuff. All that. And then if all of that was just in a, do you want that in a spreadsheet? Do you want that in an email? Do you want that in a document? When all of that processes, what's the best place for that to live? Or do you want to have like a Monday style board that you're looking at? Yeah, I was just picturing it just like updating whatever my CRM is. And then it's just sliding in, and then what is the action you're going to take next? When this has been processed and all the data is in, what should it be ready to do next? Like, what button are you going to hit to do what step? Are you going to look at it? Are you going to analyze it? Yeah, well, then we're going to look at it. And now it's telling me what is already telling me what's missing without me having to spend the time to go through it. But the next step is going to be: if you can have ExactMate online already transcribe the file, then you can tell it be like, these are the items that are missing. Add these items to the ExactMate file that you've already transcribed. Or transcribe the file and add these line items as well. And then now it's doing all the work. Then when it's done, it spits out the, it's an ESX, ESX is the file format for ExactMate. So it sends you the ESX file, and then we can load that into ExactMate. We can look at it.

We can make sure that it's all there. I feel like we should just start with one thing to make sure it works and then add. Yeah. Like, just start with gutter apron and just add. So upload it, it gives you all the right information to verify it, and it gives you the gutter apron. Okay. And then once we have that, everything else is going to be very similar. And like the next thing will be like ice and water shield. Like, do this, do this, do this. Yeah. Does it have ice and water shield? Yes. Does the number that it has match this equation? And no, it doesn't. Then it should have this number and it should be this amount. Add that to the process. Yes. Okay. That's easier than I thought. But I captured it. Is that GPZ? Yeah. I'm also going to toss this into God. I wonder how some of these places are going to make it. Which place are you looking at now? I mean, I just, I don't see how.
