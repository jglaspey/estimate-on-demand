 
Them: Response, it only it only gives you one.  
Me: It only gives you more So just give me, like, one thing.  
Them: So it'll just give you, like, one thing.  
Me: Even though  
Them: Even though  
Me: like, you might say, like, mentally,  
Them: like, it might say, like, Valley Metal, but it  
Me: it's also  
Them: there's also  
Me: gutter.  
Them: Gutter Apron. On there.  
Me: On it. As well.  
Them: As well. And just  
Me: Just keep seems to stop.  
Them: seems to stop. Whereas before,  
Me: Whereas before, in which you both  
Them: it would do multiple. So  
Me: Yeah. I changed changed the logic and the most part, I think I improved it, but I think I also put like, pointed like, I need I need to give it more instruction.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So this is exactly what I'm looking for.  
Them: So I'm  
Me: So I'm trying to get  
Them: So I'm trying to make the notes clear  
Me: the notes clear.  
Them: but, you know, if they're not  
Me: But, you know, if they're not,  
Them: then you you gotta you gotta tell me to  
Me: know, your it.  
Them: to elaborate more  
Me: Me pull up  
Them: or whatever.  
Me: new dataset.  
Them: So  
Me: So also, if you pull up  
Them: also, if you pull up  
Me: the dataset,  
Them: the dataset, can you see at the top where it says  
Me: can you see top where it says utter utter  
Them: under underneath the title, AGR dataset, you Sew Steady, Farm?  
Me: title, the user. A state park?  
Them: Do you see that?  
Me: Yeah. You know? Okay. So then if you  
Them: Okay. So then if you click that, then it'll sort it  
Me: click that, then it'll sort it.  
Them: and you'll see  
Me: And you'll see  
Them: much easier.  
Me: much easier.  
Them: I'm just going down that list.  
Me: I just go down the list Okay. Okay. When did you do start these? I guess  
Them: I guess good question. Well, these these are the only ones that I've done.  
Me: these are the only ones that So  
Them: So  
Me: Yeah. I guess before Tuesday, or after Tuesday, I think, a lot of these or I've made enough changes that after Tuesday, I would want to know if these were after Tuesday or before Tuesday. Okay.  
Them: So  
Me: So  
Them: I don't know if you can see the activity  
Me: see the activity in here.  
Them: in your Monday with your access, but this activity log you might not I know. might not I don't know if you have access to it or not.  
Me: Yeah. Let me look.  
Them: It's fine. You know?  
Me: It's fine. Okay.  
Them: But here's basically  
Me: So  
Them: so one day ago, I did, you know, Sanchez Woods Moeller Garrison,  
Me: one day ago, I did. Know, St. Boy. More. Get  
Them: Two days ago, I did you know, rice and  
Me: know? Right.  
Them: Riviera. Worth, woods, Any Woodsbytes? I guess it is. So and then last last week was I'm just trying to do, you know, at least as many as I can at least once a day now. So  
Me: So Okay. The last last week was I'm just trying to do you know, at least. As many as I can. But Okay. And, also, like, I should be able to like, right now, I can see a list of everything that's been done based on the time it did. So I forgot I can cross reference that actually myself.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: Okay. There's a ton of UI stuff that needs to happen for it to actually be a lot nicer and more usable. But trying to save that for when like, it's actually producing  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: the content that is spot on. But now at a point though where is what it's doing useful? And if it is, what is the next step for that information to be useful to you? Like, do we want Well, we need  
Them: Well, we need  
Me: we need to get it to where we're taking  
Them: we need to get it to where it can you  
Me: It's not a  
Them: it's not currently, it's not useful.  
Me: because  
Them: Because  
Me: it's not working.  
Them: it's not working. Even 50% of the time.  
Me: 50%. So  
Them: So  
Me: is that true Is that true today or yesterday?  
Them: we need well,  
Me: Well, I just  
Them: well, I just tried to run another one, and it won't process.  
Me: tried it. Process. Just  
Them: Just  
Me: process.  
Them: processing failed. Please try again. Correct?  
Me: There. Please try again. Correct?  
Them: Three times.  
Me: Really? But  
Them: But  
Me: but  
Them: but you know, like I mentioned,  
Me: yep. Like I mentioned, what I mentioned before, it's just  
Them: like I mentioned before, it's just giving  
Me: giving one  
Them: one result  
Me: So And  
Them: And and that and that those results can be useful. But one result  
Me: and that and that those results can be used But one result is not useful because I  
Them: is not useful because I can I can look at the estimate?  
Me: can look at it.  
Them: Figure that out in ten seconds too. So  
Me: So obviously,  
Them: obviously, the end user of this, which may be, like, a, like, a roofer that doesn't, like,  
Me: the end user of this should be a like,  
Them: send it. May be useful, but it needs know, most of these are gonna have at least  
Me: four things on there Okay. On almost every single  
Them: four things. On there. On almost every single one.  
Me: So  
Them: So  
Me: Okay. I don't know that would be  
Them: and then the Valley the Valley information needs to be  
Me: the Volley  
Them: adjusted that it that it's returning because it's  
Me: it's returning. Because it's it's kind  
Them: it's kind of  
Me: ready, but it's  
Them: right, but it's  
Me: it's okay.  
Them: if you look at my notes on molar Martha Moeller,  
Me: So  
Them: So like,  
Me: but  
Them: this one if I pull up the  
Me: This one. Like, you.  
Them: that might not be  
Me: Okay.  
Them: a good one. To reference. I made a note. On one of these those quite long. Okay.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: Max Woods.  
Me: K. Got him. So  
Them: So when it returns this  
Me: this results.  
Them: result, says Valley Metal flashing is required. Valley flashing is essential for proper water drainage, whatever. That's not correct. So what what is correct is that the the code requires that a valid lining is used. And the valley lining could be metal. Or it could be modified bit. Or it could be a self adhering blah blah blah blah blah. So it could be one of those three things. So  
Me: Water damage. That's not correct. So what is correct? Is that the the code virus that I'm now finding in here. And a valid money. So it could be one of those three things. So instead of  
Them: instead of  
Me: talking about  
Them: talking about  
Me: But  
Them: what the those three items depend on how the shingles are woven and valid.  
Me: the three items depending on how the shingles are going. A  
Them: Or if they're not woven. And I included the code language in that note  
Me: language in that note. For that.  
Them: for Max Woods  
Me: So it's like an open  
Them: So if it's, like, an open valley,  
Me: Then it has to be two five medical service.  
Them: then it has to be two ply's mineral surface. Rolled roof. For closed valleys, it has to be one five smooth rolled roofing  
Me: The class. Week.  
Them: which is essentially ice and water barrier. So  
Me: So and for both  
Them: for OpenValleys,  
Me: valley. They have to be So does the  
Them: it has to be metal. So but because the AI won't know because they're not looking at photos, and the estimate doesn't say,  
Me: what  
Them: what the value is.  
Me: Actually, it's all not  
Them: Actually, some estimates do say what the what the value is.  
Me: been said about it. Then  
Them: Depending on the insurance company.  
Me: But  
Them: But  
Me: anyway, should reference value  
Them: anyway, it should reference Valley lining.  
Me: line.  
Them: Not not ballet metal.  
Me: Okay.  
Them: Hopefully,  
Me: Open up.  
Them: hopefully, that makes sense.  
Me: Makes sense. Now is that a I don't know what state this is in, but is that a state specific  
Them: It's like a  
Me: requirement? It's like so most states base  
Them: so most states base their codes off of  
Me: topic.  
Them: They're very similar.  
Me: Okay. It's not it's not exactly the same.  
Them: If not if not exactly the same.  
Me: For a lot  
Them: For a lot of states.  
Me: states. So  
Them: So the  
Me: the  
Them: I can't  
Me: I can forgot. I can't think of the state where that would be required. Okay.  
Them: Valley Line, I can't think of the state where that won't be part.  
Me: So That's a good  
Them: A good question. We may have to  
Me: question. Have to once we get the  
Them: once we get this working, we're gonna have  
Me: working to teach it.  
Them: to teach it. By certain jurisdictions.  
Me: But jurisdiction. Yeah. I mean, what I imagine is that so the workflow that I'm kind of imagining is that, you know, like, to start with, it's just using, like, its own its own, like, wisdom, so to speak. And trying to do things. But as we go, it would be, like, my my assumption is that we'll start to create, like, a library of documentation And then so it could be like, oh, this is a this type of roof and it's in this jurisdiction, and that means we should go check the document that has anything specific for those two things. Make sense?  
Them: Yeah. I mean, I have  
Me: Yeah. Okay. I have  
Them: so for example,  
Me: so for example, I  
Them: I sell  
Me: sell like, a  
Them: like, a  
Me: a library  
Them: a library of documentation for the state of Nebraska.  
Me: I'm gonna take for state of Nebraska. For $50.1500 Yeah.  
Them: For $1,500. So yeah, man.  
Me: Yeah. I mean,  
Them: I mean,  
Me: if you know what you're doing,  
Them: you know what you're doing, you'll make that  
Me: you'll make that. You'll make that  
Them: you can make that back on three jobs.  
Me: So it's still worth  
Them: It's totally worth it.  
Me: like,  
Them: Like and I'm gonna continue making these because I in the in the  
Me: in a  
Them: in the in the  
Me: in the  
Them: areas that we're working because we we have to compile this documentation anyway.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So I'm working on one for South Carolina at the moment, but  
Me: So we're not my point is, like, we can get that to  
Them: my point is, like, we can give that to the model. And  
Me: Yes, please. Send that over, and I will implement it right away.  
Them: yeah, I'm okay.  
Me: So I feel like one of the questions I really need to ask though is just like, budget and money. Because I think I've or I think I proved a basic proof of concept now I'm working on making it more reliable. And then the next step is turning it into more of an app where, like, you have an admin and Tom and everyone else has, like, a login and it's a lot more of a system that is useful. As well as starting to implement knowledge bases and test checking those knowledge bases But I wanted to just find out, like, hey, like, spending money and I I apologize that I don't know if it was clear that you were gonna be auto renewed, and I feel really about that. I don't wanna feel shady or shady at the name of the  
Them: No. No.  
Me: It's fine.  
Them: Fine.  
Me: But But  
Them: But I but I can afford  
Me: but yeah. But to spend  
Them: to spend $3,000 a month.  
Me: 3,000. Dollars a month. I  
Them: I know we're I'm gonna have to spend more money  
Me: know.  
Them: to get this  
Me: Rolling.  
Them: rolling, but, like, I don't know. Can't spend more than, like, $15,000 probably off the top of my head.  
Me: Okay. That makes Yeah.  
Them: But you know, business yeah. Business is kinda slow. There we go.  
Me: So I I canceled this  
Them: So I I canceled the subscription, so it just wouldn't get auto billed.  
Me: situation. So I'm just waiting Great.  
Them: And so and I understand, you know, there's gonna be additional expenses and and getting it to a useful format.  
Me: The.  
Them: It's gonna  
Me: Still it's good.  
Them: it's gonna take investment.  
Me: To It's  
Them: I get that.  
Me: format.  
Them: But as far as, like, what we have now, like, I feel like like,  
Me: Like, to get this  
Them: to get this  
Me: to get this working in a way that  
Them: to get this working in the way that it looks right now, where just so it  
Me: just so it works.  
Them: just so it works as a as a rough proof of concept. I feel like $9,000 is is reasonable.  
Me: Absolutely.  
Them: But but we we need to get to work.  
Me: Yeah. I mean, of all, I'm I'm enjoying working on it. And just so you know, like, there's been several days where I put five, six hours in and, like, ran against the wall trying to figure out why something wasn't working. And, like, that's on me. I'm here like, I love the fact that I'm learning.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And I don't want you to pay for that learning.  
Them: Yeah. I understand.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I'm not I I mean, I don't  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: like you're taking advantage of them. Just don't worry about it.  
Me: Take that. Start. And I  
Them: Like,  
Me: okay.  
Them: I know you're always gonna be fair with me, and I know  
Me: But I can't  
Them: you know? I mean, I'm just gonna be honest with you.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: If I can't afford something,  
Me: Like that. So  
Them: So I'm not I'm not worried about the money.  
Me: Well, here's here's what I here's or here's what I'd like to propose. Let's not charge you any more money. Let me keep working on this. And get it to a point where it feels really fucking good that when you put something in, you're really confident what comes out, and it say it helps save you time. And that anyone could use it and it's a better interface, but it's not necessarily set up for accounts and logins and all that.  
Them: Yeah. Then we can go to that.  
Me: Yeah. Then, like, once we're like, fuck. Yeah, dude. I put two files in, and what I get back is immediately useful and helpful, and we are moving. Yep.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And then when it's time to move beyond that, let's have a conversation about what that looks like.  
Them: Is there a way  
Me: It's It's I think  
Them: I think that's  
Me: It's the.  
Them: a great plan. Is this  
Me: Is this  
Them: is this is there a way to for you to tell the model, like, when it makes a mistake or when it's doing when it's  
Me: Correct?  
Them: correct?  
Me: Yes and no. There's not at the moment, there's not a built in auto generating like, instruction or improvement instructions. But when I but the what I'm looking for is to get some enough feedback, which I think you have, that now I can go and be like, hey. This should have caught  
Them: Okay.  
Me: this. What do we need to change so that that doesn't get missed next time? And then make sure, like, okay. What it needed was it needed this information in this format in this location. So we put that there. Great. That shouldn't ever get missed again. And then the next time something comes up that's getting missed, we identify it and, you know, like, and some changes are gonna end up, like, covering multiple mistakes. And some changes are gonna be really, really, like, oh, that is a piece of knowledge you didn't have. And what we need is to like, go get more of that knowledge and put it into the knowledge base. So think there's kind of two things like that. And then there's gonna be times when, like, I don't understand.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: So we're gonna have to go and just run it a couple times and get some understanding. Another possibility  
Them: I just  
Me: oh, go ahead. I just  
Them: I just ran another one.  
Me: write  
Them: And so I'm just gonna stop testing this because there's  
Me: and so I'm just gonna start testing this. Because  
Them: I feel like  
Me: I feel like  
Them: something  
Me: something. That  
Them: that  
Me: okay.  
Them: okay, something that got tweaked  
Me: Something like that. Sweet.  
Them: Let me actually  
Me: Pizza  
Them: do you still see my screen?  
Me: sweet. Yeah. Also, let me know I what I only see the AGR data. Table. But let me know what Okay. Yeah. So just out of FYI, if you ever see at the top where it says EOD, agentic flow for cell, If it ever has a bunch of stuff also, that means it is a staging environment for a test What's it called? A a test  
Them: Okay.  
Me: branch. Okay. But you should most of the time, that is the URL. And I just wanna make sure that you're tracking and not accidentally getting into a different one, but you shouldn't  
Them: So I shouldn't  
Me: That shouldn't happen. So it should so should I  
Them: So should I leave should I delete this?  
Me: the check the check the No. No. No.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: Okay. It would say, like, EOD, agentic flow,  
Them: Okay.  
Me: Jason and Justin, something something product test. And then it would say, Vercel app results, etcetera. Okay.  
Them: Okay. Don't think I've seen that.  
Me: So, basically, before Vercel,  
Them: So mhmm.  
Me: you just want those three words. If it's more than that before Vercel, then somehow got on a branch. Okay.  
Them: Okay. So for this one,  
Me: That's one.  
Them: let's just go this is Thomas Nielsen. If you're in the in the AGR  
Me: That's  
Them: dataset.  
Me: it.  
Them: I don't know how necessary It's gonna be really hard to get this right.  
Me: To get this right.  
Them: This because this isn't  
Me: This is this  
Them: this isn't correct.  
Me: Okay. That is hard to get right. I have been struggling with that.  
Them: It's hard, man. Even even for  
Me: Hard. Yeah.  
Them: me, sometimes it's hard. But for this one, I can see what it did.  
Me: Alright.  
Them: I'll show you. Oh, I'll show you if you wanna no. So here's the here's the estimate. And it's getting this right.  
Me: It's getting us Because it's getting this  
Them: Because it's getting this replacement cost value.  
Me: request. But  
Them: But  
Me: this is for  
Them: this is for only  
Me: one  
Them: one coverage. There's multiple coverages in this file. Here's another one. Summary for coverage a But it says zero here. But that doesn't mean it's it's so complicated. And, actually, State Farm makes it is the most complicated in this respect.  
Me: most helpful. Respect.  
Them: Other ones, it will it'll actually probably work very well.  
Me: So  
Them: So  
Me: Jeff,  
Them: just because  
Me: because this even appears, we have the estimate  
Them: this even appears on the estimate  
Me: I know  
Them: I know that State Farm is paying something for it.  
Me: Otherwise  
Them: Otherwise, it wouldn't appear.  
Me: appear.  
Them: Here.  
Me: So  
Them: So then as a human,  
Me: I have  
Them: I have to scroll down here  
Me: scrolling here. And I find this fucking.  
Them: and I find this fucking app. This  
Me: This  
Them: p w a r r. Which means paid when  
Me: actually  
Them: actually repaired or replaced.  
Me: this  
Them: This this fucking clown State Farm think that doing it their way  
Me: Thanks. there.  
Them: is more effective  
Me: More.  
Them: than doing it the way that ExactMate has built it for you so you don't have to invent your own fucking thing.  
Me: Thanks. So, basically, the  
Them: So, basically, there's, like, some mystery  
Me: mystery.  
Them: number  
Me: Number.  
Them: that they're gonna pay for this amount.  
Me: That there  
Them: And what what happens is we have to do this manual calculation to figure it out.  
Me: And, actually,  
Them: And, actually,  
Me: this is just  
Them: this adjuster didn't even do this correctly. He's supposed to  
Me: do the sprint. Please. To  
Them: write there's a standard line item note in State Farm where it has a different text, and then it then you're supposed to put the amount that will be paid. If you actually do it. It's basically like, we'll pay this when you show us that you actually did it.  
Me: that is when you show Okay.  
Them: So  
Me: So in this one,  
Them: in this one, it's  
Me: it's it's super complicated.  
Them: it's super complicated, but  
Me: But I  
Them: I'm sure I believe that in the other ones that aren't State Farm, it won't be  
Me: So  
Them: so hard. But, yeah, I mean, you could see here, it tells, you know,  
Me: yeah. To see here. So you know, pick up the model.  
Them: AI the model thinks it's like, oh, yeah. Here's the fucking total.  
Me: It's like because  
Them: Because  
Me: but  
Them: but it but it's not.  
Me: but So  
Them: So and then  
Me: awesome.  
Them: also switch back.  
Me: Switch back.  
Them: This  
Me: Just  
Them: just needs to be 23 o three.  
Me: point. Four. Three.  
Them: So this is the square footage.  
Me: So  
Them: Of the roof. But  
Me: rate. But one square  
Them: one square is equal to  
Me: to?  
Them: and and only only roofing inside of use squares, but one square is 100 square feet.  
Me: So  
Them: So the  
Me: yeah, that's all.  
Them: it's always this number divided by the 100. And then here,  
Me: So  
Them: so  
Me: right.  
Them: if I go I'm looking at the estimate. And so  
Me: So I  
Them: I don't know if this I don't have the photos. So on this house,  
Me: I to go. So  
Them: in front of me, I don't know if this house has valley metal or not. I don't know anything about it.  
Me: But  
Them: But the ice and water  
Me: the ice. Is water.  
Them: may this this calculation  
Me: This this calculation for us  
Them: for ice and water may include  
Me: water. May Yeah.  
Them: the amount required for the valid That's  
Me: That's sort of thing, like,  
Them: so I think, like,  
Me: it would be  
Them: it would be  
Me: it would be helpful.  
Them: it would be helpful  
Me: To have  
Them: to have an ice and water  
Me: calculation?  
Them: calculation  
Me: As one of the  
Them: as one of the  
Me: the steps.  
Them: the steps. And  
Me: I'm sure  
Them: I'm sure you can get  
Me: Okay. I'm free.  
Them: I'm sure you can get one of the AI models to explain that.  
Me: Explain. Yeah. Two.  
Them: To you.  
Me: So  
Them: So  
Me: I think  
Them: just have to wait.  
Me: previous one. So, like, now is just definitely, these are the types of feedbacks I need to  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: like, now it's the fine tuning. Yeah.  
Them: Well so but, again, on this one,  
Me: So again, this one. One.  
Them: it  
Me: It it  
Them: it didn't identify anything beyond the  
Me: Yep.  
Them: beyond the valley metal and  
Me: It should.  
Them: it should have identified gutter because this assessment only has drip For me, that's, like, the easiest thing. For this model to identify. If there's an eave on the roof,  
Me: Whichever  
Them: which every fucking house has an eave, no matter what,  
Me: They're  
Them: There you can have a house without a rating. You can't have a house without any Like, then there should be  
Me: k. Like, like,  
Them: gutter apron. And if there isn't gutter apron in the carrier estimate, then the model should point that out to the user. Like,  
Me: that user.  
Them: so I feel like it's also the lowest hanging fruit  
Me: It's also.  
Them: for money. I just had a competition with you guys this morning about Like, dude, so it's so easy.  
Me: So it's it  
Them: Take one fucking picture. Crazy. These guys, like,  
Me: I  
Them: I  
Me: I  
Them: I was talking to him this morning. I was like,  
Me: sorry. Did you know how  
Them: do you go to I was like, do you go to the office every day?  
Me: I because  
Them: Because you get on a roof. Right? And you and you you put the ladder up against like, the gutter, and then you climb up on the roof, and you go past the gutter,  
Me: And then you get  
Them: and then you get up on the roof. So you, like, you you're, like, going past the  
Me: the the  
Them: this  
Me: area every  
Them: area every time you get on a roof.  
Me: time you get into it.  
Them: And I'm like, do you go into the office every day? And he's like, yeah. I go I go by the office every day. And I'm like,  
Me: If you  
Them: if you could get paid  
Me: and it's for  
Them: an extra $80 every time you walk in the office, all you do is take a picture of the front door,  
Me: every It's  
Them: while you're going through it anyway. Would you do that? And he's like, yeah. Fuck yeah, dude. Extra $400 a week. I'm like, exactly.  
Me: Take this fucking  
Them: Take this fucking photo at the top of the ladder when you go past the fucking gutter apron. Every fucking day, dude. How many times do I have to say this? Anyway, it's the easiest money.  
Me: easiest.  
Them: In this business.  
Me: Like,  
Them: Like, literally, Gutter Apron will pay my overhead.  
Me: go. For  
Them: For my entire company. Because it's it's crazy. So, anyway, that in this model has to be, like, the easiest thing. And I don't actually  
Me: Okay.  
Them: maybe if you  
Me: You.  
Them: maybe we should have a shared spreadsheet of the items that you're that you're asking it to look at. And and I can put in there, like, the caveats of these items. Because  
Me: You know,  
Them: know what I mean?  
Me: If we had, like, five or even 10 like, examples. That, like, it should always return this. And if it's not returning this, it's not right.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. I also feel like  
Them: I also feel like there's instances this has spurred me.  
Me: there's instances that's just perfect. Where  
Them: Where  
Me: I could use  
Them: I could easily make, like, a mermaid chart for these specific items.  
Me: these specific Oh, please do that then.  
Them: Yeah. So, like,  
Me: Yeah. So for example,  
Them: example, I'm looking at this  
Me: looking at at this this test  
Them: this estimate.  
Me: like, for this one that  
Them: For this one that we just tested. So  
Me: So  
Them: as an example of a mermaid chart, these are laminate laminated composition shingles. Laminated composition shingles should not have  
Me: have.  
Them: hip and ridge cap cut from three tab shingles.  
Me: Have.  
Them: But the  
Me: But so the.  
Them: the adjuster, I'm sure, changed this because I'll I would ask them to change it.  
Me: Check. This. Result. Them to change it.  
Them: And they would and they'll change it to a regular purpose purposely manufactured ridge hip or ridge cap. And  
Me: So  
Them: so the mermaid chart would be something like identify what type of roof  
Me: what type  
Them: what type of shingles on this roof. Is it laminate or a three cap?  
Me: people. Is it?  
Them: 9090% of these roofs are gonna be asphalt shingle roofs. Sometimes we have metal roofs. So modified big roofs where so then it identifies laminate shingle.  
Me: So  
Them: Now identify the ridge cap. And it identifies the ridge cap. If it identifies a normal ridge cap or high profile ridge cap, then there's no action to be taken. Identifies the cut three tab, then this is the action that should be taken. And it should recommend this amount. Of regular bridge caps or that make sense?  
Me: Yes.  
Them: I could  
Me: I  
Them: So I can do that. I can do that pretty easy. What what are what was the other what was did we what did I make the mermaid chart in for and clog? I can't remember.  
Me: I I there's a I would say  
Them: You told me that  
Me: Cloud or ChatGPT have  
Them: that's why.  
Me: what's called Canvas to write on. So either  
Them: Oh, okay.  
Me: we do  
Them: Oh, that didn't clog.  
Me: whatever  
Them: What I'll do at GBT is I cancel my Clog. I canceled it because I was wasn't using  
Me: You can't stand Claude? I can't. Can't. Ah, okay. But  
Them: I'm I'm having a lot of problems with GBT lately too. Like, it it freezes up and just stops, and I to, like, refresh the page. Yeah.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: But it's just like  
Me: Figure out.  
Them: out to conquer the world so it's too busy to deal with my group questions.  
Me: Down for, like, a couple hours earlier this week, and, like, the memes were just flying. Like, oh, no. My brain need to use.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Oh, look at that image. Oh my god.  
Them: Brutal. What?  
Me: That  
Them: This? Yeah. That's automatically generated by the  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: by the EagleView report, but it's down here at the bottom too.  
Me: Okay. That's a little better.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. But  
Them: But you want the model to look at this because it's  
Me: because it's don't  
Them: obviously, it's confusing, but  
Me: it's  
Them: they're so varying between insurance carriers of Some of them don't show the the sketch in their estimates and some do. Blah blah. So  
Me: Okay. Well, yeah, I would say mermaid charts, Like, what might end up happening is there's basically create so I have it set up now so that there's an orchestrating agent. And it hands off jobs to sub agents. That one is to just go and, like, get all the data out of the PDF. But then it asks sub agents, look at this and determine this. And provide that. And so for each mermaid chart, an agent could be like, go through that and examine for this. Just return yes or no in the results. So that it's not trying to do too many things at once.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: Yeah. All of those things that you're sending is great, again, like, if you wanna show me, like, here's five and here's a exactly what I would want to get back. If I put these two things in, this is exactly what I wanna get back. I can I can adjust that? And then I can run it until that's exactly what we get back every time. Okay.  
Them: Okay. I'm just looking at I'm just checking Okay. I'm just looking at I'm just checking the other numbers. Extracting this data. From the roof report should be I mean, Monday AI  
Me: Group. Report. Monday. AI.  
Them: does it.  
Me: Very  
Them: Very easily. And perfectly.  
Me: And  
Them: And  
Me: the prompts are  
Them: the prompts are  
Me: you know,  
Them: minimal.  
Me: Yeah. So  
Them: So  
Me: What I was trying to do, though, is to set it up so that it has all the information so that we can ask it hard problems.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Yeah. I think that's  
Them: Yeah. I think that's great.  
Me: great. Yeah. And so  
Them: The  
Me: I'm I I believe that now I'm at the point where everything is in place, we just need to get the questions and the answers right.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: You may wanna you may  
Me: You may I hope you'll help her out.  
Them: I don't know if it'll help or not. You you you would have to tell me, but you may want to have  
Me: A problem.  
Them: a drop down  
Me: Down. Order.  
Them: where your data  
Me: Data.  
Them: what insurance carrier it is. Or is it identifying the insurance carrier? I can't remember. Okay.  
Me: Yeah. It is. And it has a confidence check as well.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: So that  
Them: Then it knows. Because that'll that would help with  
Me: good. That's  
Them: one it it would be learning that the differences.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: The nuances.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: What the fuck?  
Them: All good, man.  
Me: Software I'm sorry about that. Will work on that.  
Them: Oh, Well, I'm sure if I loaded two more docs  
Me: Well, I'm  
Them: well, let's see. If I load if I load two more documents in here,  
Me: I've actually never seen that error before. So I'm not sure why it's giving me that.  
Them: See what this one says.  
Me: Okay. It's failing. I'll I'll dive into this and and sort it out.  
Them: It's not gonna  
Me: It's not gonna oh, yeah.  
Them: oh, yeah. Alright. So  
Me: Okay. So okay.  
Them: from me besides these? Mermaid? Mermaid charts?  
Me: Like I said, if if you have a file, like, these two files, and this is exactly what I would expect. Or a perfect response would be this. That is useful. And if it's possible you've already given that to me, And if that's the case, let let's just resync and so that I can tell exactly what you're referring to. Okay.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: Cool.  
Them: Cool. I'll what's I don't use  
Me: Okay.  
Them: I'm trying to do I Get this to I don't think I wanna I think I'd rather just do it manually.  
Me: The  
Them: This gourmet chart.  
Me: oh, what I would do is I would go to any of these, like, 4.5 is fine or 4.103 three is now the same price as 4.1, which is crazy. So I'd use o three, and I would just hit that microphone button, and I would just explain one whole workflow mermaid chart style. Like, if this happens and this happens and this should happen, but if that happens, it should be this. And just barf it out.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: And then say, make me a mermaid, flowchart your Canvas. Okay. And then look at the mermaid flowchart, and if it's not right, tell it what to fix. And if it is right, download it and send it to me.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: Me. Okay.  
Them: Do you want one big one? Or do you want one for each item?  
Me: For  
Them: Because I was thinking, like, I could make one big one, but you feel like you already have that.  
Me: Have. That.  
Them: Already built out with our agents and stuff. So  
Me: Yeah. I would say, start with the individuals that are really specific to, like, if this, then that.  
Them: okay,  
Me: Because I'm gonna try and create an agent that just follows that, so it's not getting too confused trying to do too many things at once.  
Them: Okay.  
Me: Okay. Alright.  
Them: Alright. Cool. So anything besides  
Me: Cool. So anything  
Them: those mermaid charts?  
Me: anything  
Them: I mean, I'll I'll in those charts, I'll identify  
Me: the energy  
Them: the enders the ideal end result.  
Me: ideally. End result. Okay.  
Them: And and even the code text to include.  
Me: And and even the code. Text. And put Awesome. Oh, yeah. That's something. If you have any documentation or I wasn't able to log in and get those the codes that you said, So if you can send me a list of codes for certain things, I can update the code documentation. Because right now, it's referencing an I I I wasn't able to log in, and so I just referenced incomplete version of codes. To have example. But if you have a more complete version of codes in any format, markdown to Excel or whatever, send that over and I can improve our code generation. So  
Them: So the document that I sent you let just look through it. It has through it. It has all the code. It has the it has a this is for Nebraska. But this building code is, like,  
Me: public building is, like, it's a  
Them: it's a it's a standard residential code that most  
Me: for us.  
Them: states abide by.  
Me: Abide by Okay.  
Them: And, and it only has  
Me: And it only has I'm on section nine.  
Them: section nine, which is  
Me: The code  
Them: the code requirements for roof coverings.  
Me: for recovery.  
Them: So that's the most  
Me: So that's the most the most  
Them: the most relevant  
Me: When when did you silence me?  
Them: like,  
Me: Like, ten minutes ago.  
Them: minutes ago.  
Me: Oh, okay. Via That's that's your key to  
Them: I just sent it to your g j's. So this PDF is the one that I'm selling  
Me: Okay. So is the moment. Settling.  
Them: for $1,500, and it's got some additional emails and co documentation and documents from  
Me: So  
Them: So it's very well, it's very Nebraska specific. I guess. I'm just looking through here. But as far as the code goes, the entire building code is in there from I don't know what page to what page. I need to fucking update. Page.  
Me: You know what? Though, this document will be great. I will for now, I can at least implement that document. And have it reference that when it's creating the codes. For the supplement. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. And  
Me: You might wanna  
Them: you might wanna  
Me: edit the document.  
Them: edit the document  
Me: Or if I wanna just take the  
Them: or you might wanna just take the the  
Me: video.  
Them: the building Actually, I have I have the let me send it right now. I just have the  
Me: The doc  
Them: the document  
Me: that's only doing those.  
Them: that's only the building codes.  
Me: You don't wanna give it  
Them: Because you don't wanna give it  
Me: you don't wanna have it spitting out in that information.  
Them: you don't wanna have it spitting out Nebraska information.  
Me: Okay. But  
Them: But  
Me: but the building goes  
Them: this building code is universal. Generally.  
Me: So general.  
Them: We'll have to do the the deep dive into individual jurisdictions.  
Me: Jurisdiction. A lot of states just have  
Them: But a lot of states just have  
Me: one code  
Them: one code. And maybe, like,  
Me: a major city has, like, someone  
Them: a major city has, like, some modifications to that code.  
Me: agents. To them. So Okay.  
Them: So  
Me: So so that  
Them: so that  
Me: PDF, you could give  
Them: PDF, could give it  
Me: to  
Them: to reference  
Me: records. The code.  
Them: the code. Also,  
Me: Also. Could  
Them: you could as part of the  
Me: part the That's  
Them: beginning, you could ask  
Me: beginning could have. It  
Them: it to identify the residential building code that applies to this address.  
Me: too. Identify. The resident. Building. Applies to the So  
Them: So  
Me: for example,  
Them: for example, like, it would it would be able to find that in  
Me: like, would be find that. Like, by.  
Them: like, if I ask Chatty, would be able to find that information.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: What residential building code applies? For its address and and you know, what's the  
Me: The  
Them: URL of the minutes blocks that  
Me: one? That that you  
Them: that I can contact regarding this billing code?  
Me: So  
Them: So  
Me: Okay.  
Them: And then that's it, man. Let me see you gotta see this. Fucking bland AI, dude. This shit's This new login shit is whack. Oh, that's not my it's not the one I used. Stupid password, bro.  
Me: I know. I think it's fucking annoying.  
Them: I mean, like, is it more secure, I guess? I don't I don't really know. I'm not sure. Like,  
Me: I think a lot of it is just so that it forces you to to a real phone number so that there's a little bit of accountability on what you're doing. Because you can't get a phone number that's not VoIP unless actually have a ID.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. Supposedly.  
Them: I mean, there's ways around it. I had I did it myself.  
Me: I Sure.  
Them: My Google Voice number Now I'm not getting the message. Come on. Fucker. Well, I was gonna show you, but not gonna keep you on the phone. Guess it's you. It's pretty dope, dude. I'm I'm halfway done with this receptionist. Yeah. She's  
Me: Really? Yeah. She is. She's  
Them: she's amazing.  
Me: like,  
Them: Like,  
Me: it's great.  
Them: it's crazy.  
Me: It's I don't know what  
Them: It's I don't know what they're doing.  
Me: they're doing. Doing. Okay.  
Them: But, like, yeah.  
Me: Yeah. I  
Them: I like, you know, I had I had to call fucking State Farm, and you gotta do the  
Me: you on. Do that. So  
Them: tell me what the claim number is you're talking about.  
Me: Bye.  
Them: They  
Me: So number  
Them: I have to do it three times every time I call.  
Me: times.  
Them: You know?  
Me: So  
Them: So  
Me: I know  
Them: I don't know why they don't get get the support to 500 company. Can't get a a fucking bland AI like, better person to  
Me: like, answers all  
Them: answer these calls. Well,  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: alright. Much more time. But then what I wanna do is I wanna get her fucking break. No. I'm not logging in today. What I wanna do is get her to  
Me: No.  
Them: get her working really well and then figure out how to connect her to Monday. So, like, someone calls in and  
Me: Under the  
Them: an adjuster calls in,  
Me: And it's calling about.  
Them: and is calling about a specific claim, she can  
Me: Funny. Chicken. Reference.  
Them: reference  
Me: That  
Them: that file and tell adjuster exactly what we're looking  
Me: my tough because exactly  
Them: for. And  
Me: and if  
Them: and it even instructs  
Me: get stressed. I didn't even stress that.  
Them: I've even instructed her never identify herself as the AI.  
Me: I've never identified  
Them: To any caller. And then I was talking to George the other day. He's like, you gotta put in, like, a secret code word to, like, break her so I can call in and talk dirty. Yeah,  
Me: An ant anti safe word.  
Them: Yeah. So  
Me: Alright.  
Them: alright, man. Well, I'll make these I'm gonna start on these charts now because I don't know. Too many estimates right today.  
Me: Okay. I will keep cranking on this. Thank you. It's a lot of fun. It's fun to work with you. Thank you.  
Them: Thank you, man. Appreciate it. Alright, buddy.  
Me: Alright. Bye.  
Them: See you, man.  
Me: FYI, had a chat with Storm. He's great. He did pause the renewal and, we have a clear deliverable for what he's paid so far. And we have a clear comes next when that deliverable is met that will turn payments back on. And we should be rocking. I am definitely learning a shitload on this, but it is the best training money I'll ever earn. Just wanna give you a quick heads up. I'm working on AI one zero one course today. And we'll see you at 01:00. Try Hello? Good. Time for an early lunch.
