NOTE: The following content is from an in-person conversation between me and the client. assume this is in his own words about what he's seeing when looking at an early report:

Just go through what you were seeing and just state it, and I'll capture that feedback. 

So, what I'm seeing is you want to talk about all of it. Okay, so what I'm seeing, obviously, is that the codes are hallucinating. The codes will need to be referenced against an actual code chart, which we'll get into to provide correct examples. 

For example, the felt—I mean, it is required for manufacturer specifications, but it's more important that it's actually required by code, not just manufacturer installation instructions. 

Valley lining—so that one, the way I'm seeing it right now, it's going to be really hard for it to get valley lining right because you'll never see the words "valley lining" in an estimate, because a valley lining is one of several different items. It could be valley metal, it could be rolled roofing with the amount proper to cover a valley, or it could be ice and water barrier with the proper amount of square footage to cover the valley. So that one will be very difficult. 

And then the drip edge—obviously, it is in the estimate, it's just there's a difference in measurement. 

And the ridge cap—I don't know, hip and ridge cap standard profile is in the estimate. It's assuming things are missing, but they're not. 

Also, can you just quickly talk through the ice and water barrier again? So I'll have to give you a calculation for this. But its ice and water barrier has to extend 24 inches if you're measuring vertically inside the exterior wall of a roof. So if the roof is vertical, then it has to go 24 inches inside the exterior wall of the roof, but on the roof surface. So that 24 inches, depending on the steepness of the roof, could mean that the ice and water barrier could extend four feet or more based on the predominant pitch. 

And then also, it's required in the valley. But these are all from Nebraska and Iowa, and in this area, everyone has valley metal, and you don't have to do two types of valley linings. So valley metal spices, and you don't actually need, it's more very in the valley.
