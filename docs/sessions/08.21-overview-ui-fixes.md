    message: "fix: enable Start Review button for ANALYSIS_READY status and add PDF download functionality"
    timestamp: 2025-08-21T14:00:00Z
```

## Context
Users reported that the "Processing..." button on the Overview page was not clickable even when document analysis was complete. Additionally, the Analysis Status card needed UI refinements for better user experience.

## Objectives
1. Fix the non-clickable "Processing..." button issue
2. Update the Ready for Review icon to be consistent with the Start Review button
3. Remove unnecessary document icon from Document Evidence heading
4. Add functional download buttons for PDF documents

## Implementation Details

### Status Mapping Fix
- Added `ANALYSIS_READY: 'reviewing'` to the `mapJobStatus` function in `app/job/[jobId]/page.tsx`
- This ensures jobs with ANALYSIS_READY status display "Start Review" instead of "Processing..."

### UI Improvements
- Changed Ready for Review status icon from `AlertTriangle` to `Play` for consistency
- Removed the ðŸ“„ emoji from "Document Evidence" heading for cleaner appearance
- Added download buttons next to page counts with hover effects

### Download Functionality
- Created new API route at `/api/jobs/[jobId]/documents/[docType]/download`
- Implemented file path resolution for both estimate and roof report documents
- Added proper content-type headers and filename disposition for PDF downloads
- Handled file reading with proper error handling and TypeScript types

## Key Decisions
1. Used the existing `Play` icon for Ready for Review status to maintain consistency with the Start Review button
2. Implemented download functionality server-side to handle file access securely
3. Used Uint8Array conversion for NextResponse compatibility with binary data

## Testing & Validation
- Ran `npm run build` to ensure no TypeScript or compilation errors
- Fixed all build errors including:
  - Incorrect Prisma import path
  - Next.js 15 route params type (Promise-based)
  - Null checks for optional database fields
  - Buffer to Uint8Array conversion for NextResponse

## Outcomes
- âœ… Start Review button now properly displays and is clickable when jobs are ready
- âœ… Analysis Status card has improved visual consistency
- âœ… Users can download PDF documents directly from the Overview page
- âœ… Build passes without errors

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any issues with PDF downloads in production
- Consider adding loading states for download buttons
- May want to add download progress indicators for large files
- Could add error toast notifications if downloads fail
