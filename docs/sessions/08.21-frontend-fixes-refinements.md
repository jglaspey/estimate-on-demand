# Session Summary: Evidence-first Ridge Cap Retrofit

## Quick Summary
Standardized ridge-cap evidence behavior: removed hardcoded page links, added dynamic evidence references from analysis to UI, and ensured jump-to-evidence navigates to the correct document and page.

## Files Changed
- `components/RidgeCapAnalysis.tsx` - Use `evidenceReferences` prop to derive pages; disable jumps when evidence missing
- `app/job/[jobId]/page.tsx` - Pass `evidenceReferences` from analysis results into ridge-cap card

# Session Details

```yaml
date: 2025-08-21
duration: 1h
session_type: refactor
primary_focus: Ridge cap evidence navigation standardization
contributors: [AI]
branch: main
commits: []
```

## Context
Previously, ridge-cap card hardcoded evidence navigation to "page 4". We’re shifting to the evidence-first system where analyzers provide evidence metadata.

## Objectives
- Eliminate hardcoded page navigation
- Read evidence references from analysis results
- Gracefully handle missing evidence

## Implementation Details
- Added `evidenceReferences?: string[]` to `RidgeCapAnalysis` props
- Parsed estimate/report pages from human-readable evidence strings
- Updated buttons to use derived pages; show `---` when missing
- Passed `evidenceReferences` from `analysisResults.ridgeCap` in the job page

## Key Decisions
- Keep string parsing minimal for now; will move to typed `EvidenceRef` soon
- No change to viewer contract yet (still accepts {docType, page})

## Testing & Validation
- Manual: verified buttons render with dynamic page numbers when evidence present and disable gracefully otherwise

## Outcomes
- Ridge-cap UI now links to the correct page per job
- Path cleared to integrate typed `EvidenceRef` + highlighting next

## Next Steps
- Implement `EvidenceLocator` and typed `EvidenceRef`
- Wire text highlighting from EvidenceRef.textMatch in `EnhancedDocumentViewer`
- Retrofit other rule cards to the same pattern

# 08.21 - Frontend Fixes and Refinements

**Session Type:** Feature Development & UI/UX  
**Focus Area:** Frontend Improvements  
**Date:** August 21, 2025  
**Branch:** `main`  

## Objectives

- [ ] Address frontend issues and refinements identified by user
- [ ] Improve UI/UX consistency across the application
- [ ] Fix any visual or interaction issues
- [ ] Optimize frontend performance and user experience

## Session Overview

Working on frontend fixes and refinements for the EOD Insurance Supplement Automation System. The system currently has a strong foundation with 64% task completion and 83.9% subtask completion. Most core functionality is implemented, making this an ideal time for UI/UX polish and refinement work.

## Current System Status

Based on Task Master analysis:
- **16 completed tasks** (64% completion)
- **1 in-progress task** (Task 7: Business Rule Analyzer Implementation)
- **137 total subtasks** with 83.9% completion rate
- Core systems operational: extraction pipeline, database, UI components

## Key Areas Available for Frontend Work

1. **Task 25: Review Process UI Refinements** - Ready for implementation
   - Enhanced visual hierarchy
   - Refined header information display
   - Better rule step visualization
   - Search functionality in document viewer
   - Migration from Radix UI to Tailwind Catalyst

2. **Task 7.3: StarterStripAnalyzer** - In progress, may need UI support
3. **Task 9: Report Generation System** - Pending, UI components needed

## Key Findings & Decisions

**Issue #1: Enhanced Document Viewer Showing Multiple Files (RESOLVED)**
- **Root Cause**: The documents API was injecting a mock roof report when no real roof report existed, causing 3+ tabs to appear
- **Additional Issue**: The TabsList component was hardcoded to `grid-cols-2` which couldn't handle variable numbers of documents
- **Solution**: 
  1. Removed automatic mock roof report injection from `/api/jobs/[jobId]/documents/route.ts`
  2. Added deduplication logic to filter duplicate documents by fileName and fileType
  3. Made TabsList dynamic with conditional grid columns (1, 2, or 3+ columns)

**Expected Result**: Document viewer should now show only actual uploaded documents with proper tab layout

**Issue #2: Roof Report Misidentified as Estimate (RESOLVED)**
- **Root Cause**: Document type detection logic only checked for "roof" in filename, missing other indicators
- **Specific Case**: `hover_pro_measurements_17388256.pdf` was labeled as "Estimate" instead of "Roof Report"
- **Solution**: Enhanced document type detection with comprehensive indicators:
  - **Roof Report indicators**: roof, report, eagleview, hover, measurements, aerial, satellite, diagram, sketch
  - **Estimate indicators**: estimate, xactimate, symbility, customer_copy, final_draft, quote, bid
  - **Fallback logic**: Uses page count (roof reports typically ≤15 pages, estimates >15 pages)

**Expected Result**: Documents should now be properly classified with correct tab labels

**Issue #2.1: Enhanced Image-Based Fallback Detection (IMPROVED)**
- **User Feedback**: Page count fallback was unreliable; suggested using image count instead
- **Analysis**: Confirmed hypothesis - roof reports have significantly more images than estimates:
  - **Estimate**: 5 images across 18 pages (mostly logos/diagrams)  
  - **Roof Report**: 40 images across 39 pages (aerial photos, measurements, visual data)
- **Solution**: Replaced page count fallback with image count heuristic:
  - Documents with ≥8 images → roof_report
  - Documents with <8 images → estimate
  - Excludes logo files from count
  - Only used when filename indicators are ambiguous

**Expected Result**: More accurate document classification, especially for edge cases without clear filename indicators

## Technical Implementation

*[Details about implementation approach and key technical decisions]*

## Files Modified

- `app/api/jobs/[jobId]/documents/route.ts` - Removed mock roof report injection, added deduplication logic
- `components/EnhancedDocumentViewer.tsx` - Made TabsList dynamic for variable document counts

## Challenges & Solutions

*[Document any significant problems encountered and how they were solved]*

## Testing & Validation

- **Build Validation**: ✅ `npm run build` successful with no errors
- **Document Detection Testing**: Both documents correctly identified via filename indicators
- **Image Fallback Testing**: Confirmed image-based fallback works for edge cases
- **API Testing**: Documents endpoint returning correct `fileType` classifications
- **UI Testing**: Enhanced document viewer should now show proper tab labels

## Extraction Page Boundary Fix

### Problem
- Ridge cap line item appeared on page 8 of the PDF but extraction assigned it to page 7
- This caused evidence links to point to the wrong page, breaking user trust

### Root Cause
The extraction service had issues with page boundary detection when line items appeared at the top of a page.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Updated Extraction Prompts**:
   - Added explicit page boundary rules to both v2 and Claude extractors
   - Specified that items at the TOP of a page belong to THAT page
   - Added instructions to look for page footers to confirm correct page

2. **Created Page Validation System** (`lib/extraction/utils/page-validator.ts`):
   - Validates extracted page numbers against actual content location
   - Fixes common off-by-one errors automatically
   - Checks adjacent pages for misplaced content
   - Logs corrections for debugging

3. **Integrated Validation**:
   - Added validation step to v2 orchestrator after line item extraction
   - Added validation to Claude line item extractor
   - Made validation generic to work with different line item types

### Key Changes
- `lib/extraction/v2/line-item-extractors.ts`: Enhanced prompts with page boundary rules
- `lib/extraction/claude-line-item-extractor.ts`: Updated prompt and added validation
- `lib/extraction/v2/orchestrator.ts`: Integrated page validation
- `lib/extraction/utils/page-validator.ts`: New validation utility

## Download Route Bug Fix

### Problem
The roof report download buttons weren't working, showing "Error: Download failed: Not Found" when clicked.

### Root Cause
The download API route assumed both files (estimate and roof report) would have the same timestamp prefix, but they had different timestamps:
- **Estimate**: `1755549331697_0_27-87n4-84z_customer_copy_final_draft_2t.pdf`
- **Roof Report**: `1755549331713_1_hover_pro_measurements_17388256.pdf`

The route tried to replace `_0_` with `_1_` in the estimate filename, creating a non-existent file path.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Smart File Search**: Instead of constructing paths, the route now searches the uploads directory for files containing roof report keywords
2. **Robust Fallback**: Falls back to the old method as a safety net
3. **Better Error Logging**: Added specific error messages for debugging

### Files Modified
- `app/api/jobs/[jobId]/documents/[docType]/download/route.ts`: Improved file detection logic

### Verification
- ✅ Roof Report Download: Returns HTTP 200 with correct PDF
- ✅ Estimate Download: Still works perfectly
- ✅ Build Success: No TypeScript errors

## Next Steps

- Review deep linking functionality to ensure evidence navigation works seamlessly
- Continue standardizing rule analysis system for other rule types

## Addendum — 2025-08-25 — Evidence Navigation & Auto‑Scroll

### Summary
- Standardized rule-driven auto-scroll to evidence and persistent highlighting across the viewer.
- Enabled evidence-first flow end-to-end for Ridge Cap: clicking evidence chips jumps and highlights in Extracted view; rule page auto-scrolls to primary evidence on load.
- Implemented smart PDF switching and prefetch for roof reports (for faster switching to measurements).

### What Works
- Estimate evidence (Ridge Cap):
  - Auto-scrolls on page load to primary evidence based on rule config.
  - Clicking chips jumps to the correct page and highlights text (regex/literal safe).
- EnhancedDocumentViewer:
  - Persistent highlighting (combines rule evidence + click target + legacy patterns).
  - Regex-safe matching; `rehypeRaw` enabled for `<mark>` rendering.
  - PDF prefetch on page load to warm cache; auto-switch to PDF for `roof_report` docType.
  - Tab switch respects in-flight evidence jumps (no unintended reset to page 1).
- Rule system:
  - `lib/rules/rule-config.ts` gains `autoScroll` (enabled | priority | delay) for per-rule behavior.
  - Ridge Cap configured to prioritize `estimate` evidence.

### Known Gap (Roof Report Measurements)
- Jumping to roof report measurements still lands inconsistently on page 1 in some cases.
  - Current mitigation: viewer attempts to resolve page via `textMatch` against extracted pages and falls back to Hover default page 2; however this is not yet reliable in PDF embed.
  - Next options: (1) enrich extraction to provide precise `sourcePages` for measurements; (2) adopt PDF.js for DOM-level paging/highlighting.

### Files Touched (since last entry)
- `components/EnhancedDocumentViewer.tsx`: persistent highlighting; PDF prefetch; auto-switch to PDF; respect pending jumps; re-key PDF embed.
- `app/job/[jobId]/[ruleSlug]/page.tsx`: standardized auto-scroll on load using rule config; passes evidence array into viewer.
- `lib/rules/rule-config.ts`: add `autoScroll` options and enable for Ridge Cap.
- `lib/analysis/ridge-cap-analyzer.ts`: default roof report evidence page to 2 when unknown; build typed `EvidenceRef` set.
- `app/api/jobs/[jobId]/documents/[docType]/download/route.ts`: robust roof report path resolution.

### Build & Deploy
- `npm run build` → ✅ successful.
- Merged branch `rule-enhancements` → `main` and pushed.

### Next Steps
- Roof report deep link accuracy:
  - Prefer analyzer-provided `sourcePages[]` for measurements.
  - Consider PDF.js-based viewer to guarantee programmatic page navigation/highlighting.
- Roll the same auto-scroll + evidence pattern into other rules (Starter/Drip Edge/I&W).
