# Session Documentation Format

This folder contains development session summaries that track progress, decisions, and changes made during each work session on the EOD Insurance Supplement Analysis System.

## Quick Reference

ðŸ“‹ **[SESSION INDEX](./INDEX.md)** - Quick overview of all sessions with brief summaries and status indicators

For detailed session documentation guidelines, continue reading below.

## File Naming Convention

Files are named using the format: `MM.DD-brief-description.md`

Examples:
- `08.18-ridge-cap-analysis-ui.md`
- `08.20-pdf-viewer-improvements.md`
- `08.25-database-migration.md`

## Document Structure

Each session document follows this standardized format:

```markdown
# Session Summary: [Brief Title]

## Quick Summary
[2-3 sentence overview of what was accomplished]

## Files Changed
- `path/to/file1.tsx` - [brief description of changes]
- `path/to/file2.css` - [brief description of changes]
- `path/to/file3.ts` - [brief description of changes]

# Session Details

```yaml
date: YYYY-MM-DD
duration: [estimated session length]
session_type: [feature, bugfix, refactor, infrastructure, etc.]
primary_focus: [main area of work]
contributors: [list of contributors]
branch: [git branch name]
commits: 
  - hash: [git commit hash]
    message: [commit message]
    timestamp: [ISO timestamp if available]
```

## Context
[Background information and starting state]

## Objectives
[What we set out to accomplish]

## Implementation Details
[Technical details of what was built/changed]

## Key Decisions
[Important architectural or design decisions made]

## Testing & Validation
[How changes were tested and validated]

## Outcomes
[Results and current state after the session]

## Next Steps
[Identified follow-up work or areas for improvement]
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Create immediately after session completion** - Document while details are fresh
2. **Include timestamps** - Use ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) when available
3. **Link to commits** - Include git commit hashes for traceability
4. **Be specific about file changes** - List actual files modified, not just general areas
5. **Document decisions** - Capture the "why" behind technical choices
6. **Include validation steps** - Note how changes were tested
7. **Identify next steps** - Help future sessions understand where to continue
8. **Update the session index** - Add a brief entry to [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md) for quick reference

## Session Types

- **feature** - New functionality development
- **bugfix** - Fixing existing issues
- **refactor** - Code improvement without functional changes
- **infrastructure** - Build, deployment, or tooling changes
- **ui/ux** - User interface and experience improvements
- **integration** - Connecting systems or services
- **documentation** - Adding or updating documentation
- **testing** - Adding tests or improving test coverage

This documentation format ensures consistent session tracking and provides valuable context for future development work.
