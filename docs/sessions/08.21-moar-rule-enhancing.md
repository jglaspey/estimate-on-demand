## Context
The current business rules UI components work well but have inconsistent patterns across different rules. The Ridge Cap rule has proven UI patterns that should be standardized across all business rules for better user experience and maintainability.

## Objectives
1. Standardize evidence display across all business rule cards (similar to Ridge Cap)
2. Implement consistent compliant/partial/needs supplement status pills
3. Convert horizontal layouts to vertical stacking where content needs to be read sequentially
4. Create dynamic, editable rule-based notes with LLM generation
5. Improve action button placement and styling (text-only reject on left, prominent approve on right)
6. Add inline clipboard icon for copying notes instead of separate button

## Implementation Details
### Evidence Section Standardization
- ✅ Created reusable `EvidenceChip` component with page numbers and document type
- ✅ Chips are clickable and trigger document navigation via `onJumpToEvidence`
- ✅ Consistent blue color scheme and hover states across all rule types
- ✅ Shows "---" when evidence is not available

### Status Pill Enhancement
- ✅ Created `RuleStatusBadge` component with three states: compliant, partial, needs-supplement
- ✅ Consistent colors: green (compliant), amber (partial), red (needs supplement)
- ✅ Placed consistently in top-right corner of each card
- ✅ Maps from backend status values to standardized display states

### Layout Improvements
- ✅ Converted DripEdgeGutterApronCard from 2-column grid to vertical stack
- ✅ Converted StarterStripCard business rule violation from grid to vertical layout
- ✅ Better visual hierarchy with consistent spacing (space-y-6 for main sections)
- ✅ Improved mobile responsiveness by eliminating side-by-side layouts

### Dynamic Note System
- ✅ Created `SupplementNote` component with "Supplement note:" label
- ✅ Inline copy button in header (small, unobtrusive)
- ✅ Dynamic placeholder text shows rule-specific justification
- ✅ Full editing capabilities with controlled textarea
- ✅ Each rule card generates contextual supplement notes based on analysis

### Action Button Redesign
- ✅ Created `RuleActionButtons` component with standardized layout
- ✅ Left side: Text-only "Reject" button (no border, subtle hover)
- ✅ Right side: Prominent blue "Approve and continue" button
- ✅ Consistent spacing and alignment across all rule cards
- ✅ Disabled state support for both buttons

## Key Decisions
- Prioritize consistency over rule-specific variations
- Use Ridge Cap as the reference implementation
- Make all rule cards follow the same interaction patterns
- Ensure mobile responsiveness throughout

## Implementation Challenges & Solutions
### Rule Configuration Data Flow Issues
**Problem**: Several rules weren't displaying their V2 cards due to mismatched analysis keys between configuration and API data structure.

**Root Cause**: Rule configuration used camelCase keys (`iceWaterBarrier`, `starterStrip`) while API returned different key formats (`iceAndWater`, `starter-strip`).

**Solution**: 
- Standardized analysisKey mappings to match API data structure
- Fixed evidence lookup in switch statement cases
- Added comprehensive debugging to identify data flow issues
- Ensured all rules now properly receive their analysis data

### Overview Page Loading Delays
**Problem**: Rule summaries appeared with 2-5 second delays on the overview page, causing poor user experience.

**Root Cause**: Page was triggering unnecessary POST re-analysis on every load instead of using cached GET data.

**Solution**:
- Modified overview to load all rule summaries immediately from GET endpoint
- Removed unconditional POST re-run on initial page load
- POST now only triggered by explicit "Re-Run" button action
- Added proper data mapping for all four rule types in API response

## Testing & Validation
- Created V2 versions of all rule cards to allow side-by-side testing
- Components tested with various data scenarios:
  - Complete data with all fields populated
  - Partial data with missing evidence
  - Different status states (compliant, partial, needs supplement)
- Verified evidence chip navigation functionality
- Tested supplement note editing and copying
- Confirmed responsive behavior on mobile viewports

## Outcomes
- Successfully standardized all business rule UI components
- Created 4 reusable UI components for consistent patterns:
  - `EvidenceChip` - Clickable evidence references with page navigation
  - `SupplementNote` - Editable notes with inline copy functionality
  - `RuleActionButtons` - Standardized approve/reject layout
  - `RuleStatusBadge` - Consistent status indicators
- Updated all 4 business rule cards with V2 versions:
  - `DripEdgeGutterApronCardV2`
  - `StarterStripCardV2`
  - `IceWaterBarrierCardV2`
  - `RidgeCapCardV2`
- Rule page details are always expanded (no collapse), while Overview remains collapsible
- Added explicit value verification for Ridge Cap (estimate vs required) to build trust
- Fixed rule configuration and API data flow issues:
  - Corrected analysisKey mappings to match API data structure
  - Fixed evidence references for all rule types
  - Enabled Starter Strip rule availability
  - Resolved overview page loading delays by optimizing API calls
- Improved visual hierarchy and readability
- Enhanced mobile responsiveness
- Maintained backward compatibility by creating V2 versions

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Complete UI standardization across all business rule components  
2. ✅ Test with various data scenarios (complete, partial, missing data)
3. ✅ Ensure proper integration with backend rule analyzers
4. ✅ Update documentation for new UI patterns
5. ✅ Integrate V2 components into production layout

**Work Complete**: All business rule cards now use consistent, standardized UI patterns. The new components are live in the application and provide a much better user experience with:
- Unified evidence display system
- Dynamic supplement notes with LLM integration  
- Consistent action button layout
- Better mobile responsiveness
- Improved visual hierarchy

The standardization work is now complete and ready for user testing.

## 2025-08-25 Business Rule Refinement: Drip Edge Extraction & Analysis

### Context
- Intermittent discrepancy: local runs often detected Drip Edge while production frequently missed it for identical PDFs (`drip-edge-gutter-apron` rule page showed Missing). Production page reference: `https://estimate-on-demand-production.up.railway.app/job/.../drip-edge-gutter-apron`.
- Logs showed v2 extractor sometimes reported “drip_edge extraction found 1 items” but analysis consumed only ridge‑cap items, resulting in false “missing”.

### Root Cause
- The analysis step depended on `v2.lineItems` present in the latest `MistralExtraction`. In some flows the stored v2 `lineItems` contained only ridge‑cap items (from Phase 1 merge), so downstream drip‑edge logic saw no edge items.

### Changes Implemented
- lib/extraction/v2/line-item-extractors.ts
  - Expanded regex patterns and synonyms for drip edge (drip‑edge, drip metal, edge metal, DE/D.E., eave/rake drip).
  - Increased relevant-page window and improved fallback when no pages match.
  - Added explicit drip‑edge guidance to Claude prompt; model + response logging.
  - Hardened JSON parsing with recovery when Claude wraps JSON in prose.
- lib/analysis/drip-edge-analyzer.ts
  - Trust `item.category` from v2 (`drip_edge` / `gutter_apron`) in addition to text heuristics.
  - More robust detection and safer unit/total derivation; detailed item logging.
- lib/analysis/analysis-worker.ts
  - Targeted fallback: if no drip/gutter items exist in stored v2, re-run the v2 extractors against persisted page text, validate pages, and merge those items before analyzing.
  - Added input measurement logging (eaves/rakes) for auditability.
- General
  - Additional logs: chosen model, pages inspected, item counts, recovery attempts.

### Outcome
- Local runs now consistently detect Drip Edge; analysis status moves to Partial/Compliant as appropriate instead of Missing.
- Fallback ensures resilience if persistence ordering or earlier phases omit edge items.

### Files Touched (key)
- `lib/extraction/v2/line-item-extractors.ts`
- `lib/analysis/drip-edge-analyzer.ts`
- `lib/analysis/analysis-worker.ts`

### Operational Notes
- Verify `ANTHROPIC_MODEL_EXTRACTOR` is consistent across envs (defaults to `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`).
- Monitor logs for “🧩 Fallback extracted … edge-protection items” to confirm fallback path only triggers when necessary.
