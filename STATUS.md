# Project Status

## Current Phase: Ready to Begin Development 🚀

**Date**: August 12, 2025  
**Sprint**: Pre-Development Planning (Complete)

## Completed ✅
- [x] Comprehensive PRD with 40+ user stories and technical specs
- [x] Task Master AI setup with 11 tasks → 72 subtasks
- [x] UI-first dependency structure established
- [x] Development environment configured (multi-IDE support)
- [x] Git repository initialized with clean commit
- [x] Business rule specifications documented
- [x] Sample documents and test cases ready
- [x] Authentication architecture defined (Auth.js v5 + Prisma + invite-only)
- [x] Production-ready prototype analyzed and documented

## Next Up 🎯

### **Tomorrow: Task 1 - Project Setup**
- **Priority**: High
- **Complexity**: 5/10 
- **Time Estimate**: ~1 day
- **Dependencies**: None

**Subtasks**:
1. Next.js + TypeScript initialization
2. Tailwind CSS + theme configuration 
3. Project structure + routing
4. Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier)
5. Base component library

### **After Task 1: Task 11 - UI/UX Wireframes**
This will unblock Tasks 2, 6, 8 (all UI implementation)

## Key Metrics 📊
- **Total Tasks**: 11 main + 72 subtasks
- **High Priority**: 5 tasks
- **UI-Dependent**: 3 tasks (2, 6, 8)
- **Estimated Timeline**: 8-9 weeks based on complexity analysis

## Commands for Tomorrow 💻
```bash
task-master next                                    # See what's ready
task-master set-status --id=1 --status=in-progress # Start Task 1
task-master set-status --id=1.1 --status=done      # Complete subtasks
```

## Notes 📝
- UI design (Task 11) should start ASAP after basic project setup
- LLM integration research (Task 5.1) can be done in parallel
- Database schema (Task 3) doesn't depend on UI, can work in parallel
- All major UI components wait for wireframes/prototypes
- **Authentication**: Complete implementation plan in `USER-AUTH-GUIDANCE.md`
- **Prototype**: Production-ready components in `front-end-mockup/` directory

**Ready to build!** 🚀
